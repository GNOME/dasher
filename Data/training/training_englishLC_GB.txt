hello there! hi.
the dasher project. dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural continuous pointing gestures.
dasher is a competitive text-entry system wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example, (1) on a palmtop computer; (2) on a wearable computer; (3) when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse; (4) when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by eyetracker).
we expect the eyetracking  version of dasher to be an especially big hit,  as it allows the user to write text as fast as normal handwriting.
dasher is fast, efficient, easy to learn, and fun to use.
dasher is like an arcade game: `attack of the killer alphabets', perhaps.
financial times, 5th february 2002.
dasher is a zooming interface. you point  where you want to go, and the display zooms in  wherever you point.
the world into which you are zooming is painted with  letters, so that any point you zoom in on corresponds to a piece of text.
the more you zoom in, the longer the piece of text you have written. you choose what you write by choosing where to zoom.
to make the interface efficient, our software uses the predictions of a language model to determine how much of the world is devoted to each piece of text.
probable pieces of text are given more real-estate, so they are quick and easy to select.
improbable pieces of text (for example, text with spelling mistakes) are given less space, so they are harder to write.
the language model learns all the time: if you use a novel word once, it  is easier to write next time.
a big advantage of dasher over other predictive text-entry interfaces is that it is mode-free: the user does not need to switch from a writing mode to an "accept-model-predictions" mode.
another advantage is that it is easy to train the model	on any writing style: simply load up an example	file, then write away!
imagine a library containing all possible books, ordered alphabetically on a single shelf.
books in which the first letter is "a" are at the left hand side.
books in which the first letter is "z" are at the right.
the first book in the "a" section reads "aaaa..."; somewhere to its right are books that start "all good things must come to an end..."; a tiny bit further to the right are books that start "all good things must come to an enema...".
when someone writes a piece of text, their choice of the text string can be viewed as a choice of a book from this library of all books - the book that contains exactly the chosen text.
how do they choose that book? let's imagine they want to write "all good things..."
first, they walk into the "a" section of the library.
there, they are confronted by books starting "aa", "ab",
looking more closely at the "al" section, they can find books starting "ala", "alb",... "alz"
by looking ever more closely at the shelf, the writer can find the book containing the text he wishes to write.
thus writing can be described as  zooming in on an alphabetical library, steering as you go.
this is exactly how dasher works, except for one crucial point ...
we alter the size of the shelf space devoted to each book in proportion to the probability of the corresponding text.
for example, not very many books start with an "x", so we devote less space to "x..." books, and more to the more plausible books, thus making it easier to find books that contain probable text.
 tips for novices
the single most important concept that a novice user needs to understand is that one should always continue inside the text written so far: to select the book that contains "all" as its first word, one does not enter the "a" section of the library, then exit the "a" section, and enter the "l" section.
one enters the "a" section, then finds the "al" section that is within the "a" section, then enters the "all" section within the "al" section.
the second most important idea is that what you have written depends only on where you finally end up in the library, not on how you got there; so there is no need to steer carefully on your way to your destination. you are allowed to cut corners.
the dasher software consists of a language-modelling module, a rendering module, and a dynamics module.
dasher is brought to you by the inference group, led by david mackay, cavendish laboratory, madingley road, cambridge.
the research version of the software was developed by david ward. the project manager is phil cowans.
the dasher project is supported by the gatsby charitable foundation.

it is difficult to imagine that one could build a living system, out of just hydrogen and helium, and anyway the early universe was still far too hot for atoms to combine into molecules.
the lady doth protest too much, methinks. for example, it was found that elementary particles behaved rather like little tops, spinning about an axis. `what i was going to say,' said the dodo in an offended tone, `was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race.' that permitted us to start controlling the ball right away, said stram, quipping, i think i'll put that play in the book. here was another puzzling question; and as he could not think of any good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
something is rotten in the state of denmark. that wouldn't be much good for space westerns. fight the good fight. naturally, enterprises of the size of general electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time. this is very midsummer madness.
it might be possible to use genetic engineering, to make dna based life survive indefinitely, or at least for a hundred thousand years. you can lead a whore to culture but you can't make her think. `if everybody minded their own business,' the lady said in a hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it does.' in ancient times, the world must have seemed pretty arbitrary. the company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world.
come the three corners of the world in arms. so she stood still where she was, and waited. it involved scanning the radio frequencies, to see if we could pick up signals from alien civilisations. said he : we will see whether whites and negroes are treated the same around here. however, `jury-men' would have done just as well.
aggression, in the form of subjugating or killing other men, and taking their women and food, has had definite survival advantage, up to the present time. the third belief, in six points, emphasizes the deity of the lord jesus christ, and : -- emphasizes the virgin birth -- the sinless life of christ -- his miracles -- his substitutionary work on the cross -- his bodily resurrection from the dead -- and his exaltation to the right hand of god. what a piece of work is man. however, long distance space travel, will be difficult for chemically based life forms, like dna.

even if there were sound reasons for keeping us in ignorance, human nature being what it is, it is difficult to believe that someone wouldn't show off, and tell us poor benighted peasants, the secret of time travel. we'll work out about an hour on saturday, then we'll work monday and tuesday of next week, then taper off. he promised nearly 200 democratic county committee members at the meeting in the puddingstone inn : when i come back here after the november election you'll think, you're my man -- elected. i guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen -- everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. since we haven't cracked time travel yet, i have run out of time.

this means, it doesn't take into account, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, which says that an object can not have both a well defined position, and a well defined speed: the more accurately one measures the position, the less accurately one can measure the speed, and vice versa. mrs. molvar, who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand, said, we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level, and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children. interestingly enough, laplace himself wrote a paper in 1799 on how some stars could have a gravitational field so strong that light could not escape, but would be dragged back onto the star. the biggest single act would doubtless be staged by frankie himself : his inaugural wardrobe had been designed by hollywood couturier don loper, who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles. he is a law unto himself.

however, in a remarkable paper written in 1905, when he was a clerk in the swiss patent office, einstein showed that the time and position at which one thought an event occurred, depended on how one was moving. the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that she had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. however, the graph of the number of radio sources, against there strength, went up much more sharply at low source strengths, than the steady state theory predicted. he ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of washington state. you'll wonder where the chartreuse went when you brush your teeth with pepsodent.
he did not say by how much. her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `you are old, father william,' to the caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the whale drew a long breath, and said `that's very curious.' these irregularities are so little, only one part in a hundred thousand, that for years people looked for them in vain. but, for my own part, it was greek to me. the cosmologist, sir arthur eddington, once said, 'don't worry if your theory doesn't agree with the observations, because they are probably wrong.'
if working in a zinc mine, which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour, paid more than playing center field for the yankees, mantle would work in a zinc mine. once in a blue moon. it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures. but in extreme conditions, like in the early universe, or in high energy particle collisions, there could be significant loss of information. students have been using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study.
knee high to a grasshopper. there was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day. i will wear my heart upon my sleeve. `when we were little,' the mock turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to school in the sea. as those of you that were forced to learn euclidean geometry at school may remember, one of the consequences of these axioms is, that the angles of a triangle, add up to a hundred and 80 degrees.

unfortunately, in the same paper, einstein showed that the rocket power needed to accelerate a space ship, got greater and greater, the nearer it got to the speed of light. soviet premier khrushchev sent new year's hopes for peace to president-elect kennedy, and got a cool acknowledgment in reply. got the hump. information requires energy to carry it, and there won't be enough energy left when the black hole disappears. party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own.
(he had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) only a relative handful of such reports was received, the jury said, considering the widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size of this city. of course, some people would claim that we have been visited from the future. the course of true love never did run smooth. a nuclear war, is still the most immediate danger, but there are others, such as the release of a genetically engineered virus.
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war. but she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall. this may have been reasonable, given the notoriously unreliable character of cosmological observations, until fairly recently. the 187-mile illinois state toll highway, for example, was not opened over its entire length until december, 1958. until hell freezes over.
this says that the total amount of disorder, or entropy, in the universe, always increases with time. beaver away at. so the total amount of useful information in our genes, is probably something like a hundred million bits. two began in a low voice, `why the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. but i shall see what conclusions can be drawn, from the fact that life exists on this planet, at this stage in the history of the universe.
this is the key fact emerging from sunday's national election. the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. this is not only a compliment to mijbil, of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book, but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub's journey by plane from iraq to london, then by train (where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap) to camusfearna, with affectionate detail. there must be a possible history in which there is a lasting peace in the middle east, though maybe the probability is low.
though walter ulbricht, by grace of soviet tanks, may be head man in east germany, that does not give him any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone.
though last, not least in love. this time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. if this choice is less exciting than new york democrats may wish, it nevertheless must be made. less is more. no government agency could afford to be seen to be spending public money, on anything as way out as time travel.
now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked with the clock. to almost two generations of americans it must have seemed as though the existence of mr. sam coincided with that of the house. on the other hand, the remaining four directions are fairly flat, and are what we call space-time. although the resolution might have been far more specific, it was considerably tougher than the earlier one. thus far into the bowels of the land.
just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. it took two and a half billion years, to evolve from the earliest cells to multi-cell animals, and another billion years to evolve through fish and reptiles, to mammals. the bears took the lead in the first inning, as they did in sunday's opener, and never lagged. yet your editorial said : now the attorney general writes that no considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion. though this be madness, yet there is method in it.
this precious stone set in the silver sea, this sceptered isle. because time is not going to go backwards, i think i better stop now. this time, they were much better prepared and organized, and the political climate was favorable. better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. instead, it would be an ordinary point of space and time, like the north pole is an ordinary point on the earth, or so i'm told.
a little bird told me. eventually, at a critical weight and size, they will make a bottomless hole in the sheet, which particles can fall into, but nothing can get out of. nothing that is likely to happen, however, should prompt the sending of united states soldiers for other than instructional missions. night soil.
and with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: `speak roughly to your little boy, and beat him when he sneezes: he only does it to annoy, because he knows it teases.'
but it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with mr. khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted. at his wits end. that is why we don't get sunburn from a cup of coffee. he called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, `yes, please do!' but the mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker. look to coosa valley for industrial progress cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest georgia counties that are members of the coosa valley area planning and development commission.

`after that,' continued the idiot, `i cut some more bread- and-butter --' `but what did the dormouse say?' one of the jury asked. when i gave a lecture in japan, i was asked not to mention the possible re-collapse of the universe, because it might affect the stock market. after that, some of the stars would have exploded as supernovas, and scattered the heavy elements back into space, to form the raw material for later generations of stars. point percy at the porcelain. and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.
if you knew the state of the universe at some time in the past, you could predict it in the future. alas, poor yorick! i knew him, horatio. i suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!' this is shown on this next diagram, which is not to scale, because there's no way one can show a period of ten thousand years, on the same scale as billions of years. sitting next to nellie.
for example, a computer virus is a program that will make copies of itself in the memory of a computer, and will transfer itself to other computers. it also indicated that space travel to other stars, was going to be a very slow and tedious business. admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority, the councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive. do your business.
so i will give a different argument, to show that the universe contains enough matter, to focus our past light cone.
happy hitting if it's true that contented cows give more milk, why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits? an even greater limitation and danger for future generations, is that we still have the instincts, and in particular, the aggressive impulses, that we had in cave man days. we have seen better days. `hold your tongue, ma!' said the young crab, a little snappishly. an angry young man.
a scientific law is not a scientific law, if it only holds when some supernatural being decides to let things run, and not intervene. he said, let's work for peace instead of protection from aggression. just at this moment she felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. a $12,500 payment leavitt, as he entered the jury room, said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to stein for labor consultant work with five unions which organized leavitt's workers. leave the room.

but, the fact that several pulsars are observed to have planets suggests that a reasonable fraction of the hundred billion stars in our galaxy may also have planets. the frog-footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, `from the queen. in order to understand this, considered a sheet of rubber, with a weight placed on it, to represent a star. apologies are in order from anybody who said, are you sure you're not making a mistake? apple pie order.
a major national library can contain about five million books, or about ten trillion bits. this observation can be elevated to the status of a law, the so-called second law of thermodynamics. salem (special) -- for a second month in a row, multnomah county may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need, the state public welfare commission was told friday. second wind.
she did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
the deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades, rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that. he was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides, what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?' she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. `why,' said the gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore --' `two lines!' cried the turtle. some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some `unimportant.'
but for tops as small as atoms, the discrete nature of spin is very important. the illinois commission for handicapped children, which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children, of studying the needs of handicapped children in illinois, and of promoting more adequate services for them, indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children. it is difficult to say how often such collisions occur, but a reasonable guess might be every twenty million years, on average. point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first, need encouragement to get on their feet. some good news although it looked like a routine technical snapback to wall streeters it was accompanied by some good news.
the mother of young queen, mrs. g. henry pierson jr. chose a white brocade gown made on slim lines with panels of tomato-red and bright green satin extending down the back. survivors include two brothers, c. e. killingsworth, atlanta, and john killingsworth, warren, ohio; and two sisters, minnie  and mrs. bessie bloom, both of gettysburg, pa.. if this were the case, it would raise a whole host of questions and problems. it is a basket case. she folded her hands, and began:-- `you are old, father william,' the young man said, `and your hair has become very white; and yet you incessantly stand on your head -- do you think, at your age, it is right?'
in other words, the anti-trust laws, designed to reduce prices to the consumer on monday, wednesday and friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday, thursday and saturday. this is an area nearly as large as western europe; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity. by and large. big in japan. four corners of the earth.
while she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the woman and the baby -- the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. but at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting. born within the sound of bow bells. although this lecture is partly about time travel, i felt i had to give it the scientifically more respectable title, space and time warps.

the week went along briskly enough. so she began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the rabbit. we saw back to the origin of the universe. (the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself. according to string theory, which is our best hope of uniting general relativity and quantum theory, into a theory of everything, space-time ought to have ten dimensions, not just the four that we experience.
six of the best. the idea that the state of the universe at one time determines the state at all other times, has been a central tenet of science, ever since laplace's time. holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution, or a beatnik parlor or teahouse. for ever and a day. fair dealer humphrey upped the ante, asked cloture power for a mere majority of senators.
power dressing. but with the human race, evolution reached a critical stage, comparable in importance with the development of dna. the nearest thing to a straight line on the surface of the earth, is what is called, a great circle. there is one thing i know; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge. a thing of beauty is a joy forever.
at the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light, but crisp texture. it's a trick of the light. our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! the black sheep of the family. `once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the carrot began in a great hurry; `and their names were elsie, lacie, and tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well --' `what did they live on?' said jane, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking.
i therefore want to show you, that observational evidence indicates the universe contains sufficient matter, that it is like the time reverse of a black hole, and so contains a singularity. in the case of a black hole, this definite prediction involves both members of a particle pair. two of these are in or near dallas and the others away from the vicinity. it has been championed by the physicist david deutsch, and it seems to have been what steven spielberg had in mind when he filmed, back to the future.
we have not the leisure, or the patience, or the skill, to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor, the majesterial andrews norton, by saying that, while he believed jesus like other religious teachers, worked miracles, i see not how a miracle proves a doctrine.

in a universe that was essentially static, there would not have been any dynamical reason, why the stars should have suddenly turned on, at some time. as we know, the soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot; and it is still very far from certain how valid the party's claim is that in a growing number of kolkhozes the peasants are finding it more profitable, to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm. that is a well turned calf. suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and diane's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. how long the self-design phase will last is open to question.
open house. man to enter into the kingdom of god. william smythe, director of field service, told the commissioners that multnomah, as of aug. 22, had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category, leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month. the only way of avoiding this problem would be if, for some reason, the stars did not shine before a certain time. houston, we have a problem.
nothing is certain but death and taxes. the pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to notre dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it, becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty. if so, it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents. thus it would require the direct intervention of god, if the universe began at that date. thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave allied disunity.
the company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies. the answer lies in a bumper sticker that i used to have on the door of my office: black holes are out of sight. the door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade. katy bar the door.
and even if it could, it would not really help explain the origin of life, because the time available since the formation of carbon is only just over double the age of the earth.
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the white rabbit interrupted: `unimportant, your majesty means, of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke. mr. balaguer's troubles are by no means over. who wooed in haste, and means to wed at leisure. `ah, well! it means much the same thing,' said the woman, digging her sharp little chin into melanie's shoulder as she added, `and the moral of that is --"take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves."' there is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that, at the college level, the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels.
why, it fills the whole window!' for it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the ohio and mississippi valleys began to fill. the whole nine yards. this matter is of great importance, and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death, or at least serious injuries, for many veterans. the root of the matter.
it is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism. a house divided against itself cannot stand. a butterfly flapping its wings can cause rain in central park, new york. richard of york gave battle in vain. let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is -- oh dear!
each had been shot in the back several times with a.22-caliber as the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth, the soviet union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race. milk of human kindness. the thin red line. `it goes on, you know,' the sport continued, `in this way:-- "up above the world you fly, like a tea-tray in the sky.
they could be miles north and east of oxford circus, and height above sea level. seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of august have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year. above board. even though headquarters actually have been moved into the chatham building, do they believe that they can make the new name stick?
action man.
`come on, then,' said the queen, `and he shall tell you his history,' as they walked off together, dorothy heard the king say in a low voice, to the company generally, `you are all pardoned.' such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry, but there is little evidence that realtors, or at least their associations, have repudiated the principle in such clauses. he is a safe pair of hands. local derby. five figures.
history is bunk. whee the people : lovely thrush annamorena gave up a promising show biz career to apply glamor touches to her hubby, ray lenobel's fur firm here. `but everything's curious today. but today's science fiction, is often tomorrow's science fact. if these constants had significantly different values, either the nucleus of the carbon atom would not be stable, or the electrons would collapse in on the nucleus.
the chief difficulty kate found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, katharine soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. act the fool. run off your feet. oh dear! i shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the hedgehog actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, catharine started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. these regularities were most obvious, in the motion of the heavenly bodies across the sky.
there has been more activity across the state line in massachusetts than in rhode island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the sunday sales laws. that is a shot across the bows. the other guests had taken advantage of the queen's absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives. this could have taken only a few hundred million years. taken aback.
`not at first, perhaps,' said the teacher: `but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.' past it. in donnybrook, there is quite a different eire, a rural land where singing, dancing, fist-fighting and romancing are the thing. i am not doing anything, of myself.
before memory, too, clouds over, let us make a note or two of what could be seen.
however, physicists began to find other behaviour, that could be explained only in terms of quantities having discrete, or quantised values, rather than continuously variable ones. he gave the impression of never having read a word about art, but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best. "i'll be judge, i'll be jury," said cunning old fury: "i'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death."' if it does not, it should be able to survive the death of the sun, in about 5 billion years, by moving to planets around other stars. `i'm a poor man, your majesty,' the royal began, in a trembling voice, `-- and i hadn't begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the tea --' `the twinkling of the what?' said the king.
it is thought the collision of a rather smaller body with the earth, about 70 million years ago, was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs. the appestat, which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant, is located, says jolliffe, in the hypothalamus -- near the body's temperature, sleep and water-balance controls. keep body and soul together. toying with her field in the early stages, garden fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by jockey philip grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs. further, do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo?

many of you are familiar, i'm sure, with the story of my early struggles : the fire in january, 1947, that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers. i'm not so green as i am cabbage looking. a couple of days later an assistant told me he had telephoned allied arts for ticket information and was told the newspapers had made a mistake. kiss and tell.

the charter does stipulate that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible. money makes the world go round. but by the end of the three-month period, in october 1960, something approaching calm settled on the congo. they form the basis of the mental picture of the universe, held by many scientists, and almost all philosophers of science. that is a sure thing.
there could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether elizabeth did not like the look of the thing at all. the progress reported by the advisory committee is real. the real mccoy. so much for free will. his reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history, to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the american people as president of the united states, and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations.
scot free. `how cheerfully he seems to grin, how neatly spread his claws, and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws!' and walker looks stronger, seems to be throwing better than he did last year. once such super humans appear, there are going to be major political problems, with the unimproved humans, who won't be able to compete. `the trial cannot proceed,' said the king in a very grave voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places -- all,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at george as he said do.
a more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined. however much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism, not behind it. a miss is as good as a mile. there remains, of course, the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts. these are the shortest paths between two points, so they are the roots that air lines use.
castles in the air. thus it seems there may be a chronology protection agency at work, making the world safe for historians. making out. so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
unlike einstein, they have accepted the reduction in our ability to predict, that quantum theory brought about.
it was their conviction that the people should be brought up together, a grade at a time, until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history, economics and political science. "william the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. if this had been all that happened, all the matter in the universe would have ended up as the simplest element, hydrogen, whose nucleus consists of a single proton. the population of the congo is 13.5 million, divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects. oddly, the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested.
and you think you have language problems. but her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little georgette and all her wonderful adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- first, she dreamed of little charlotte herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers -- she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes -- and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. one suggestion was to modify the law of gravity, so that it became repulsive. at one time i became disturbed in the faith in which i had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both old and new testaments by a higher criticism of the bible, to refute which i felt the need of a better knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology, for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure. goedel was at the institute of advanced study, in princeton, where einstein also spent his last years.
as roommates, teammates, and home-run mates, mantle, 29, who broke in with the yankees ten years ago, and maris, 26, who came to the yankees from kansas city two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds. that is all i have to say for the moment. he sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped; the churning of straining feet, the rasp of the canvas pants; the smell and feel of hot, wet woolen sleeves across his face. there is no question as to just what is available. the first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to melanie to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.
however, one has to be careful about such arguments, because of what is known as the anthropic principle. she was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves. and there is the bright note : the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession. the division said it would be impossible to work on the line until then because of the large amount of acid sewage from jewelry plants in the area flowing through the line, heavy vehicle traffic on eddy street and tide easy street.
the belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the congo, which is rich in copper, tin, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and uranium, and cotton and palm oil. he is a whipping boy. `it's the first position in dancing.' pole position.
while he was at it, the philosopher of the kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.
rhyme nor reason. since we can't change the way the universe began, the question of whether time travel is possible, is one of whether we can subsequently make space-time so warped, that one can go back to the past. rather, they are impressed with the british government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products. chop and change. that is, you can move on the surface of the earth, in two directions at right angles to each other: you can move north south, or east west.
north and south. if the space ship went very near the speed of light, it might seem to the people on board, that the trip to the galactic center had taken only a few years. oak grove (special) -- three positions on the oak lodge water district board of directors have attracted 11 candidates. the impression has nevertheless been given during these three days, despite mr. rusk's personal popularity, that the united states delegation came to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots. all i can say is, that if governments were hiding something, they are doing a pretty poor job, of extracting useful information from the aliens.
an inside job. the countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build, he said. we can actually observe this warping of space-time, produced by the mass of the sun, in the slight bending of light or radio waves, passing close to the sun. only the families and a dozen close friends will be present. that was a close shave.
`'tis so,' said the countess: `and the moral of that is --"oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"' one of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented, once in love with amy is also, of course, one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of american musical comedy in our era. `all right, so far,' said the king, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: `"we know it to be true --" that's the jury, of course -- "i gave her one, they gave him two --" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know --' `but, it goes on "they all returned from him to you,"' said claire. the ball is in your court. there is thus a slight force pushing the plates together.
come on!' so they went up to the hippopotamus, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. but, the uncertainty principle implies that every region of space should be full of tiny virtual black holes, which appear and disappear again. full tilt. it will cost a few billion dollars, but that is chicken feed, for a project of this importance.
cost an arm and a leg.
`shy, they seem to put everything upon bill! the british defending lawyers, who today increased from three to four, demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury, the chances of their clients would improve. `in my youth,' said his father, `i took to the law, and argued each case with my wife; and the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, has lasted the rest of my life.' a frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement, experts warn, is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income. certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law, the school bills, the increase in teacher pensions, the ban on drag racing, acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits, repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue.
act your age. they were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote. suddenly one young voice rose above the others. with a lefthander going for pittsburgh, i may use don taussig in center. he may be interested in another woman, or just like being with the boys.
hell has no fury like a woman scorned. which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but clare had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. it is a matter of common experience, that things get more disordered and chaotic with time. if it is not enough that all of our internationalist one worlders are advocating that we join this market, i refer you to an article in the new york times' magazine section (nov. 12, 1961), by mr. eric johnston, entitled we must join the common market. the answer is given in the following limerick.
a catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university, following anglican evensong, at which there was a congregation of twelve, he celebrated mass before more than a hundred.  a mad tea-party.  there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the scotsman and the irishman were having tea at it: a guinea-pig was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. not only does god definitely play dice, but he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen. the government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics, and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results.
the idea is that six of these ten dimensions are curled up into a space so small, that we don't notice them. `right, as usual,' said the countess: `what a clear way you have of putting things!' this explanation of how black holes ain't so black, makes it clear that the emission will depend on the size of the black hole, and the rate at which it is rotating. in any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all.
clear blue water.
the two chains can then separate and each act as templates to build further chains. `back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the emu, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at joyce. the orioles got a run in the first inning when breeding, along with robinson, the two birds who got a pair of hits, doubled to right center, moved to third on russ snyder's single to right and crossed on kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate. the bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state. i feel these scientists have not learnt the lesson of history.
i'm sure _i_ shan't be able! i'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes of damascus ] the last obstacle in mrs. geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country -- so newly separated from egypt and the united arab republic that she hadn't been able to obtain a visa. `now at ours they had at the end of the bill, "french, music, and washing -- extra."' face the music. ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the congolese child, if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant.
with child. luckily for hannah, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. these actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms, the jury said. level playing field. on last may 1, the cardinals stood at 7-6, ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone.
it would be like fighting the french and indian war all over again, said one military man. paint the town red. a day late and a dollar short. -- come, i'll take no denial; we must have a trial: for really this morning i've nothing to do." in the morning she found rooms directly across from the excelsior at the equally luxurious hotel ambassador.
and so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. that is a rate of knots. if this figure is correct, it would mean that intelligent life on earth has developed only because of the lucky chance that there have been no major collisions in the last 70 million years. go figure.
o romeo, romeo! wherefore art thou romeo.
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. a living being usually has two elements: a set of instructions that tell the system how to sustain and reproduce itself, and a mechanism to carry out the instructions. so junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy, nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the hard knocks, while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only. it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. as we look out at the universe, we are looking back in time, because light had to leave distant objects a long time ago, to reach us at the present time.
happily for posterity, then, the boston association did not actually command parker to leave the room, though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality. therefore i'm mad.' therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come, behold the works of the lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. `there's more evidence to come yet, please your majesty,' said the wolf, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has just been picked up.' the fulton county grand jury said friday an investigation of atlanta's recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place.
because this unit is very small, one does not notice that a normal top really slows down in a rapid sequence of discrete steps, rather than as a continuous process. top notch. vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then gov. marvin griffin. the jazz three displayed their sound musicianship, not only in their own chosen set, but as the emergency accompanists for al minns & leon james, the superb jazz dancers who have now been newport performers for three successive years, gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program. during the war, we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare, which included the teaching of propaganda, both black and white and the various shades of grey in between.
dissenting views of senators two strong dissents from the majority report of the joint economic committee (may 2) by senators proxmire and butler allege that the new deal fiscal policy of the thirties did not work. on various pretexts they all moved off, and hannah was soon left alone. he says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear!' cried katie in a sorrowful tone, `i'm afraid i've offended it again!' the company has billed the united states government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the defense department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business. it is not clear that intelligence has any long-term survival value.
play by ear. back of clay scored or roughened for proper gripping surface. emory university's board of trustees announced friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible. `do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the welshman.

five years ago a house & home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealers' research council reported unhappily : only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads; only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads; only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads; only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads. peace dividend. `well, there was mystery,' the ostrich replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, `-- mystery, ancient and modern, with seaography: then drawling -- the drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he taught us drawling, stretching, and fainting in coils.' middle of the road. the energy in the packets or quanta, is higher for ultra violet and x-rays, than for infra red or visible light.
there is no dynamical reason why the motion of bodies in the solar system can not be extrapolated back in time, far beyond four thousand and four bc, the date for the creation of the universe, according to the book of genesis. go by the book. `who's making personal remarks now?' the american asked triumphantly. these voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy, the object of which is to plunder them. the situation was different, however, when it was realised that the universe is not static, but expanding.
in view of the present situation in laos, said the pentagon's announcement, we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the pacific. and third shots, but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while coe graciously putted out, giving palmer a chance to recover his composure, which he had quite visibly lost. the order in one body can increase, provided that the amount of disorder in its surroundings increases by a greater amount. some schools were technical -- the belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land, and trained many. without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future.
by contrast, there are about 50,000 new books published in the english language each year, containing of the order of a hundred billion bits of information. this is not contemporary english. she speaks the queen's english. one can not make nucleic acids in the laboratory, from non-living material, let alone rna. the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each.
all the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. `i -- i'm a little girl,' said katy, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support. nor can we be sure that every line of sight from us will pass through a galaxy.
the integrity of the office not merely requires that the secretary general shall be, as the charter puts it, the chief administrative officer of the organization, but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority external to the organization.
joanne tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: `but why did they live at the bottom of a well?' the burden of mr. wesker's message is that people living close to the soil (at least in england) are not the happy, fine, strong, natural, earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine. living together. meeting a more advanced civilisation, at our present stage, might be a bit like the original inhabitants of america meeting columbus. the editorial confrontation was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in america.
patrolman james f. simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young stickney speeding north in stewart avenue at central street. `pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said jo. in this, space and time were no longer separate and independent entities. but can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation? even the information, about what fell into the hole, could not come out again when the hole finally disappears.
but of course, there is a third direction at right angles to these two, and that is up or down. third time's a charm. with justified bitterness the author speaks of what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement, about the history of its diplomacy, about what had happened in the purges, and about what had been going on in poland and the baltic states. the call of nature. private parts.
as their name suggests, they are like string, in that they have length, but a tiny cross section. he and other soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas, such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an all people's state, and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of the whole hierarchy of soviets, starting with the supreme soviet itself. `call the next witness!' said the king. expresses thanks kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last saturday. double, double toil and trouble, fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
it did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. mr. trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back tuesday. if most of them weren't exactly specific -- well, that's the way it is in life, i guess. that's all folks.
eleven men, a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold, damp, fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare.
hit the ground running. bird's eye view. the easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values. the reduction in the number of virtual particles between the plates means that they don't hit the plates so often, and thus don't exert as much pressure on the plates, as the virtual particles outside. to be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating; it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted, allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses.
margaret was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the fox was still in sight, hurrying down it. to americans, it suggested something dark and mysterious, while to the british, there was the added resonance of the black hole of calcutta. pass the iron rations, please, and light another candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away. he is a dark horse. four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program, a responsibility similarly neglected by mr. eisenhower.
he's a waste of space. how's your father?. he said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission. the deodorant firm run by pesce has offices in the headquarters of glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 blue island av.. he seemed to have felt that the uncertainty was only provisional: but that there was an underlying reality, in which particles would have well defined positions and speeds, and would evolve according to deterministic laws, in the spirit of laplace.
robert riefling, who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd beethoven festival, penetrated deep into the spirit of the style. the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. this reality might be known to god, but the quantum nature of light would prevent us seeing it, except through a glass darkly. however, in the 20th century, there have been two developments that show that laplace's vision, of a complete prediction of the future, can not be realised. i visited the bank in march and wrote a story about the situation.
i'll go to the foot of our stairs. instead, the idea was that, as the galaxies moved apart, new galaxies were formed in between, from matter that was supposed to be continually created. there is support for the view that intelligence, was an unlikely development for life on earth, from the chronology of evolution. it was therefore natural to believe that the human race, and maybe the whole universe, had a beginning in the fairly recent past.
can you bring the networks' attention to this?
she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: `where's the other ladder?-- why, i hadn't to bring but one; bill's got the other -- bill! fetch it here, lad!-- here, put 'em up at this corner -- no, tie 'em together first -- they don't reach half high enough yet -- oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular -- here, bill! catch hold of this rope -- will the roof bear?-- mind that loose slate -- oh, it's coming down! the violinist, in particular, is very indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched and edgy. i do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really i'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!' it was, the brief writers decided, man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world. abandon hope all ye who enter here.
since we must live in one of these universes, we should not be surprised that the physical constants are finely tuned. does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves, but ready to demand that the community help and protect them? confronted with this situation, most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have, or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds. a little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! since 1953 california has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted, but not until this year did the lawmakers in sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the brown act.
like taking candy from a baby. he knew he couldn't. couldn't make head or tail of it. janet glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `twenty-four hours, i think; or is it twelve? my husband's hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. the early part of the week, and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends.
why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!' this has meant that no one person can be the master of more than a small corner of human knowledge. beyond the pale. the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr. rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged, as sen. jackson puts it, in work that does not really need doing. each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ has identified himself with human history and human death, coming as the head of a new humanity.
for instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and i could let you out, you know.' one could say that the information still existed inside the black hole. and to see the meaning of this new picture, imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today. there was a dead silence instantly, and eleanor thought to herself, `i wonder what they will do next!
it may be unstable, and life may destroy itself, or get into a dead end.
god is dead. as this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow. the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office. `i've read that in some book, but i don't remember where.' but nowadays, if you read one book a day, it would take you about 15,000 years to read through the books in a national library.
read up. `yes, it is his business!' said five, `and i'll tell him -- it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.' st. johns, mich., april 19. but science fiction fans need not lose heart. even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- i cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every american city and asking myself if our society has gone mad.
`i wonder how many miles i've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. the scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground, sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter. no matter how powerful a computer you have, if you put lousy data in, you will get lousy predictions out. whitehead is here questioning david hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from hume's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world, not directly perceived. hell to pay.
they recommended, also, that at a fixed hour, let the entire family be assembled for night prayers, followed by a short reading of the holy scriptures. `i don't know of any that do,' janet said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. but if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the general assembly, it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach. when sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions. the earth was formed largely out of the heavier elements, including carbon and oxygen.
it had to be some multiple of a basic unit. yet with all their skills, the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : the home run. and it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things -- i can't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! move heaven and earth.
it was a hive of industry.
margaret kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. as cold as any stone. new york state has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems, so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow. the georgia state chamber of commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates. the no boundary condition, is the statement that the laws of physics hold everywhere.
hold the fort. `in my youth,' father william replied to his son, `i feared it might injure the brain; but, now that i'm perfectly sure i have none, why, i do it again and again.' mrs. blanche dunkel, 60, who has spent 25 years in the dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law, ervin lang, then 28, appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two illinois pardon and parole board members, john m. bookwalter and joseph carpentier. son of a gun. this may be why many religious leaders, were ready to accept the big bang, and the singularity theorems.

(rachel had no idea what latitude was, or longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) but once you admit that some are mistakes, or hallucinations, isn't it more probable that they all are, than that we are being visited by people from the future, or the other side of the galaxy?
to do these things, the system must convert energy in some ordered form, like food, sunlight, or electric power, into disordered energy, in the form of heat. do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat. long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic, neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations, and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia. what it does : aids in reducing the incidence and severity of bloat in beef or dairy cattle on legume pasture.

anybody's guess. the szolds, like the marches, enjoyed and loved living together, even in troubled times; and, as in the march home, any young man who called on the szolds found himself confronted with a phalanx of femininity which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention to any one of them. cut off your nose to spite your face. the superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of william james was never more evident than in his letters.
so they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like frito.
joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream. martin tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions. so, can space and time be warped enough, to meet the demands from science fiction, for things like hyper space drives, wormholes, or time travel. her invitation from premier joseph smallwood is reported to be the only one extended to a woman. `not at all,' said michelle: `she's so extremely --' just then she noticed that petra was close behind her, listening: so she went on, `-- likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'
it is a no win situation: the more accurately you try to measure the position of the particle, the less accurately you can know the speed, and vice versa. win one for the gipper. cherry pick. the work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which koehler set the words there'll be no more work; there'll be no more worry, matching the spiritual feeling of the jot. had the situation been reversed, had, for instance, england been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to new england, there is little doubt that large numbers of southerners would have happily put on their old confederate uniforms to fight as allies of britain.
this is summed up in the uncertainty principle that heisenberg formulated; the uncertainty in the position of a particle, times the uncertainty in its speed, is always greater than a quantity called planck's constant, divided by the mass of the particle. in a certain perfectly definite way, the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same. william's conduct at first was moderate. smooth runs the water where the brook is deep. `that's enough about lessons,' the walrus interrupted in a very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'
but it would still leave plenty of paradoxes. many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball bearings, license brackets, and electric horns. the early appearance of life on earth suggests that there's a good chance of the spontaneous generation of life, in suitable conditions. generation x. this absence of boundaries means that the laws of physics would determine the state of the universe uniquely, in imaginary time.
henrietta, however, was at that time engaged in a lengthy correspondence with joe's older and more serious brother, morris, who was just about her own age and whom she had got to know well during trips to philadelphia with papa, when he substituted for rabbi jastrow at rodeph shalom temple there during its rabbi's absence in europe. absence makes the heart grow fonder. first of all, it is now known that pope john sees the renewal and purification of the church as an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity. power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.
during early childhood, children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in school a few years, their interest in playmates of their own age increases, and their interest in adults decreases; the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family gatherings now considers it a bore.
for me, these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage, though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose. instead, i shall adopt what is known as the weak anthropic principle. we are forced, in our behavior towards others, to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements. after the family has settled in the shelter, the housekeeping rules should be spelled out by the adult in charge. she generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
this organization will differ from existing assistance programs in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical advice to work. when the detective left, andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project. sometimes we'd have trouble persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions, and i've known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet; the next moment she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston affair. (d) since the shape of the drop conforms to the force field, it does not appreciably affect the distribution of forces in the fluid. `i couldn't afford to learn it.'
only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless, so that he would puzzle over it for days, whereas at the time it had seemed quite real. almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you. my aim in mentioning this factor obviously is not to give license to wild therapy but rather to encourage us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess, and to use them with greater confidence, precision, and professional pride. she's a bit of all right. there is no alternative.
we hope, they said, that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the holy scriptures. put the cat amongst the pigeons. but as i have said before, if i announce my candidacy, i will have something definite to say about running mates. all pricks like coughlin run it anyway, one way or another. (c) payments made pursuant to this title shall be made only to the person or persons on behalf of whom the award is made, except that -- (1) if such person is deceased or is under a legal disability, payment shall be made to his legal representative : provided, that if the total award is not over $500 and there is no qualified executor or administrator, payment may be made to the person or persons found by the comptroller general of the united states to be entitled thereto, without the necessity of compliance with the requirements of law with respect to the administration of estates; (2) in the case of a partnership or corporation, the existence of which has been terminated and on behalf of which an award is made, payment shall be made, except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), to the person or persons found by the comptroller general of the united states to be entitled thereto; (3) if a receiver or trustee for any such partnership or corporation has been duly appoint.
the appointment was made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability problems. i would like to quote from the charter of the united nations : article 17, section 1 : the general assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the organization. `it's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the creatures argue. it may be, of course, that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow communism; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of soviet communist power.
we had stopped before a shop window to assess its autumnal display, when you suddenly turned to me, looking up from beneath one of your wrong hats, and with your nervous ahem ] said : there are things i must tell you about this man you are marrying which he does not know himself.
this accounts for the wide variance in assessment practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in rhode island. their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system. it has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions, the nature of the hope of a life beyond this. how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall? aye-yah-ah-ah ] the indian was again raising his bottle, but to my astonished relief -- probably only a fraction of johnson's -- the bottle this time went to the indian's lips.
they had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.) pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made gloves on the ends of ten waggling fingers. everywhere there are little touches of humor, and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth. we few, we happy few, we band of brothers. the threadbare notion that belief, unlike behaviour, is not subject to objective analysis, has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge, since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable than social behaviour.
the common codes, for religious action as such and in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior, bind the devotees together. `only mustard isn't a bird,' penelope remarked. the ungainly bird thing ran away, and to david its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster. he glanced up in time to see roberts hurtling down on him from above, literally flying through the air, his bloody face twisted. a good many pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families -- even when it becomes clear that the germans are simply allowing the letters to blow away in the wind.
blow chunks. `same as if he had a bone in his throat,' said the unicorn: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. why it was ever forgotten for even a moment i cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone, no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ] it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders; a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike; the facet of muscular development that wins prizes. have a bone to pick. as she said this, she looked up, and there was the cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
the first mention of an electric plant in manchester seems to be one installed in reuben colvin's and houghton's gristmill on the west branch in factory point. olive branch. along the 127-mile route through great smoky mountains national park you can photograph the breath-taking peaks, gorges and valleys which come into view at every turn. a second twitched his shirtsleeve, and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm.
as the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes, thinking over the events of the past two weeks, trying to put the pieces in order.
she had a face like the back of a bus. county supervisor weldon r. sheets, who is a candidate for the democratic gubernatorial nomination, today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them. use of nomenclature, symbols, units, physical constants for punched-card or tape storage of information all literature values must be conformed to a common language. they all surrounded him, the family circle, theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens, and cousin emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan. for a moment, she could not catch her breath and then, her breath returning in short, frightened spasms, she lifted herself to her feet laboriously.
catch 22. `i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. we now have observations that point to black holes in a number of objects, from binary star systems, to the centre of galaxies. the wheel of social life spun around the royal or aristocratic centre. so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
greasy soils, which are typified by hydrocarbons and fats (esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids). ball and chain. as a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery, leesona and other companies in its industry have sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods that would increase production, yet maintain both quality and flexibility. here the absent sitter makes a date with a communicator (someone close to him who is deceased), asking him to come in at a certain hour, when a channel will be open for him. at the same time, roosevelt's federal housing administration, coupled with henry morgenthau's cheap-money policy, permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes.
in general, any outcome we choose may be labeled success. just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of mars, or even of tikopia, and no senatorial investigation will result. after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor penelope! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. at least he could climb up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again. in 1922, the united mine workers struck the coronado coal company.
by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast our minds back into the art of a remote past or an alien present, and enjoy the carvings of cavemen and japanese colour-prints; but the possibility of this effort is bound up with that development of historical thought which is the greatest achievement of our civilization in the last two centuries, and it is utterly impossible to people in whom this development has not taken place. the place was a riot of colour. at one extreme are the systems of upper new york state, where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large, sparsely populated area. county college costs to the editor : sir -- permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to.
shall i compare thee to a summer's day?.
decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town. it was possible, however, to decompose the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two viscoelastic mechanisms, each compatible with the boltzmann superposition principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence factors. although there was some variation in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or to variation in wall effects, the photochemical exchange in the gas phase was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate. if the observations disagreed with the predictions of the no boundary hypothesis, we would have to conclude the hypothesis was false. one may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams which intersect the earth's orbit.
the reason is, i think, my awareness that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets us nowhere, and that i am simply too old to hope. there is a conflict among the defendants. we have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic and free countries; we also have, in consequence, the duty to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways. basically, the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units, a variable mixer, a nozzle carriage assembly, and, in many cases, a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidifies into foam. `are you content now?' said the caterpillar.
this intellectual approach to spiritual life suited me well, because i was never content to lead a divided life. context is of extreme importance. such errors would contribute to a gradual genetic drift, which seems to occur in all populations. the state ballet of rhode island, the first incorporated group, was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge of the art of ballet in the community, to promote interest in ballet performances, to contribute to the cultural life of the state, and to provide opportunity for gifted dance students who, for one reason or another, are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional state; and now, therefore, do i, john a. notte, jr., governor of the state of rhode island and providence plantations, proclaim the week of monday, november 13, 1961, as the state ballet of rhode island week, requesting all rhode islanders to give special attention to this unusual event which should contribute to the cultural life of the state. mr. nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor.
but no president ever before referred to his as a lousy job (as walter trohan recently quoted president kennedy as doing in conversation with sen. barry goldwater). according to the new theories, the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors. several times it came near breaking, and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from jerry mulligan's big band, which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since john hammond found count basie working in a kansas city trap. folk-lore, superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints. he has a nose for crime.
piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist, but also because god will not stop him; as piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : his justice is not of this world. far from the madding crowd. `chorus again!' cried the lion, and the cheetah had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `the trial's beginning!' was heard in the distance. today a battle cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern army, esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables.
they all three had another cup of coffee.
my cup runneth over. other brothers later joined them for instruction with oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic was added to bible reading, german, and danish in the informal curriculum. the customer loses again. there was collateral damage. a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
fortunately, the debt of gravitational energy will not have to be repaid until the end of the universe. a third thomas bushell (1594-1674), much loved by bacon, called himself the superlative prodigall in the first part of youths errors (1628) and became an expert on silver mines and on the art of running into debt. however, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:-- `'tis the voice of the lobster; i heard him declare, "you have baked me too brown, i must sugar my hair." bergson and leroy announce that the secret is the center of a philosophy and thereafter a hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity. i have nothing to declare but my genius.
here are the two preambles : federal constitution, 1789 we the people of the united states, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america. in such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument. one can define life to be an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, and can reproduce itself. here briefly in this humble tribute i have sought for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country. thus it fits the definition of a living system, that i have given.
very soon after his arrival in little rock, pike had joined one of the most influential organizations in town, the little rock debating society, and it was with this group that he made his debut as an orator, being invited to deliver the annual fourth of july address the club sponsored every year. stand and deliver. `i deny it!' said the squirrel. most of these, with horrible exceptions, were conceived as is a ship, not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind, nor to deny its force, but as a means to survive and enjoy it. he or his deputy or one of their seven assistants, all full colonels, mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day.
the terms renewal and refreshed, which often come up in aesthetic discussion, seem partly to derive their import from the renewal of purpose and a refreshed sense of significance a person may receive from poetry, drama, and fiction. it becomes most evident in his description of christ as the second adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality. it beggar'd all description. during the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment, susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness, but after a short time this will disappear.
it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of his family.
but some people won't be able to resist the temptation, to improve human characteristics, such as size of memory, resistance to disease, and length of life. to the middle of september 1918, there had been fewer than 10,000 deaths from disease in the new army. they divide up the household chores : cerv does most of the cooking (breakfast and sandwich snacks, with dinner out), mantle supplies the transportation (a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible), and maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium. the potters, in particular, had virtually eschewed freehand drawing, elaborate motifs, and the curving lines of nature, while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe. on the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : one asked for help for the blind, another help for orphans, and the third for relief for the war refugees.
he was a back seat driver. all the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the food and drug administration of the federal government. mr. sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence, with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of english, with a thick shower of sophisticated, cultural references. minors minors must also file returns if they earn $600 or more during the year. set the apples in the pastry-lined tin, spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter, with as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a fresh bay leaf, then lay on a cover of pastry, and gild it with beaten yolk of egg.
i will give you a nest egg. the electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly, bedfast with a chronic disease, or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy. there is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members of the population that the element of power, primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power, has been exerted on actors in the system, particularly in regard to mate selection. some people have therefore suggested that life came to earth from elsewhere, and that there are seeds of life floating round in the galaxy. an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel needs, plans for the future, qualifications of those on the job, and bright prospects elsewhere.
when these fields are surveyed together, important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence, a continuity of thought and expression including many traditions, primarily literary, religious, and philosophical, but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even, to some extent, with science. the conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed, he said, and added field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program. to win her favors, her husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle from his employer. this is that the classical theory, does not enable one to calculate what would come out of a singularity, because all the laws of physics would break down there. what better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the connally amendment -- an act which could expose the united states to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court, enable us to utilize it, and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order?
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at rebecca, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. the poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it. while the pupil sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that penelope could hardly hear the words:-- `i speak severely to my boy, i beat him when he sneezes; for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases!' in the middle grades, however, he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader, helping to make plans and carry on group activities, and setting up rules governing the enterprise.
the sweep of space, the delicate counterbalance of the white masses, the over-all completeness and unity, the originality and imagination, all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece.
most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions. all areas of history were either favorably or adversely affected by the geographical environment, and no respectable historian could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of geography. simultaneously, a variety of environmental supports -- a calm but not too motherly homemaker, referral for temporary economic aid, intelligent use of nursing care, accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twins' feeding problem -- combined to prevent further development of predictable pathological mechanisms. they were asked to vote true if they thought they had seen him make the error, false if they thought he had not; and cannot say if they were not certain. a recent, and more pertinent action, has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for engineering.
a fragmented society (3) over the years, individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed. the unshielded flux is given in the last column; these figures constitute the best estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the earth. comprehensive examination of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method. and he added in an undertone to rebecca, `really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. we must, therefore, have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine the literary and place-name evidence which bears upon the problem.
so it was that when mr. brown and mr. sharpe first saw the french tool on exhibition in paris in 1868, they brought a sample with them to the united states and started brown & sharpe in yet another field where it retains its leadership to this day. (b) all research within the united states contracted for, sponsored, cosponsored, or authorized under authority of this act, shall be provided for in such manner that all information, uses, products, processes, patents, and other developments resulting from such research developed by government expenditure will (with such exceptions and limitations, if any, as the secretary may find `-- so long as i get somewhere,' sharon added as an explanation. what are the chances that we will encounter some alien form of life, as we explore the galaxy. he bases his present contention on the general right to explore, indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume.
he can be expected, however, to examine and interpret the information already available; to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children; and to utilize opportunities, arising in connection with regular classroom activities, for gaining a better understanding of his pupils. a third possibility is that there is a reasonable probability for life to form, and to evolve to intelligent beings, in the external transmission phase. extra, extra, read all about it. one possibility is that the formation of something like dna, which could reproduce itself, is extremely unlikely. during the early part of this century, the brown & sharpe works in providence were unchallenged as the largest single manufacturing facility devoted exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world.
another way, in which life could fail to develop to an intelligent stage, would be if an asteroid or comet were to collide with the planet. always troubled by poor circulation in his feet, he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them. there was no way to predict what they would do, and the only hope was to win favour by gifts or actions. i ask you to do me the last favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening, about which time i sh
as one added more layers of paint, the ball would eventually fill half the space.
in both cases the finger-post represents pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms. after spending two nights (wednesday and thursday) in catskill, the deputies again headed for the vermejo to finish their business. others, which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs, have balconies. to me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams, an' the sweetest flower that grows. fly by the seat of your pants.
here the war would flame to its focus, and here lewis littlepage had come. but it is not too difficult to visualise a two dimensional surface, like a saddle, or the surface of a football. `they're putting down their names,' the giraffe whispered in reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.' the concern they felt for me was such as i shall never forget and for which i will always be grateful. in contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations, even in the field, are more formal.
along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death, because they did eat in disobedience; and disobedience to god entails death. forbidden fruit. if a massive star, which has burnt up its nuclear fuel, cools and shrinks below a critical size, it will quite literally make a bottomless hole in space-time, that light can't get out of. patterson moos research our patterson moos research division has made further very encouraging progress in development of fuel cells. i hadn't been doing as much work as i used to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever.
they were staring at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared. hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings. there was considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messengers, who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group. this was the steady state theory, proposed by bondi, gold, and hoyle. to gild refined gold, to paint the lily.
you grant that?' `in my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, `i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box -- allow me.  a paying guest. but because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by means of the capacities with which words endow it, we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction, in the sphere of politics, on which decisions hang.
when the mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, sharon thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `let us get to the shore, and then i'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs.'
and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly. does the surface hide a quite different picture? neither hide nor hair. `then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?' the stranger's eyes were large and sad, as if phil haney had hurt his feelings.
the natural and primary aesthetic attitude is to enjoy contemporary art, to despise and dislike the art of the recent past, and wholly to ignore everything else. let me illustrate. and our question is, is such an implication consistent with what we meant? in one now-historic first interview, for example, the transcript (reproduced from the book, the first five minutes) goes like this : the therapist's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has, for example, avoided stressing you, which would imply disapproval; or surprise, which would set the patient apart from other people. it is always a temptation for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others.
all these emotions were screwed up to new heights when, after acceptance and the first rehearsals, there ensued such a buzz of excitement among parisian music lovers that duclos had to come running to rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the king's amusements, and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau. hospital officials said the injury was severe but the youth was in good condition last night. such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument, and therefore of questionable justification. it can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates. before they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head, hard.
democrat stanley h. dent, chairman of the house military affairs committee, declined to introduce the bill. his assignment was not a new one because baker had sent him to the mexican border in 1916 to investigate lurid newspaper stories about lack of discipline, drunkenness, and venereal disease in american military camps. i couldn't invite viola to our house, for mother snobbishly refused to receive her. however, this need not involve problems with determinism or free will, if the probabilities are very small, for histories in which space-time is so warped, that time travel is possible over a macroscopic region. the capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting and the same is true of country development programs.
they would have been hotter than the sun, and would have burnt the original hydrogen and helium, into heavier elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and iron. an iron hoof. determine if the particular state's unadjusted allotment (result obtained in item 11 above) is greater than its maximum allotment, and if so lower its unadjusted allotment to its maximum allotment. put your nose out of joint.

he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole -- when the whole is too large to grasp. there is a project now on, to map the entire sequence of human dna. various methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water. mary was free to marry again, not knowing that the sturch had secretly given her a divorce, thinking that death had dissolved her marriage. we will hatch, match and dispatch.
the long grass rustled at her feet as the porcupine hurried by -- the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool -- she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the soldier and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of tracey ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution -- once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the teacher's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it -- once more the shriek of the rhino, the squeaking of the lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable whale. she served up a square meal. `may it please your majesty,' said two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying --' `i see!' said tracey, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. vicky kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at fuhrmann junior high school, 5155 fourteen mile road east.

the third choice, negotiation, presupposes, as russian behavior demonstrates, a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable. gertrude could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of heorot or the palace of priam. gavin began to nod. it's as good as a nod and a wink.
if high accuracy is required in preflight leveling, it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs (this also minimizes the noise problem). there was a big noise. this is called imaginary time, because it is not the kind of time we normally experience. when someone says, for example, they took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me, it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made. when he heard of his brothers' anger, palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages.

okay, stormy, this isn't the place for fun and games. okay. its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham. some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the town's insurgent democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.

he had returned to the pension a week ago. these specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention, by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom, and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children. if a child loses a molar at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble. in revulsion, on the other hand, the pessimism is a case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's right to speak as he does. information can not be carried free, as those of you with phone bills will know.

industry costs we assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced (the average cost curve is horizontal, and therefore is identical with the marginal cost curve), and is the same for every firm (and therefore for the industry).
newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that judas, too, had been able to smile. they could eventually replace dna based life, just as dna may have replaced an earlier form of life. it resembles, too, pictures such as durer and bruegel did, in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary, the representation of a proverb, for example, or a deadly sin. in this way, the system can satisfy the requirement that the total amount of disorder increases, while, at the same time, increasing the order in itself and its offspring. still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself `now i can do no more, whatever happens.

but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary (low-voltage) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity. more than that, allied air had complete superiority in the eighth army's sector. by the very nature of the situation, it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management. the only requirements on dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the forms. `if you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,' said harriet, seriously, `i'll have nothing more to do with you.

red tape. at the same time, i am aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign, since theirs is a science of paradox : if one hates, they say it is because one loves; if one bullies, they say it is because one is afraid; if one shuns, they say it is because one desires; and according to them, whatever one fancies one feels, what one feels in fact is the opposite. can you see a tea leaf. one of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development projects -- men and women with the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics, and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages, the mountains, the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations. magwitch terrifies pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a bogy man who may softly creep his way to him and tear him open, imbruing his hands in him.

trick or treat. catherine's first war against the grand turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty quite favorable to her. however, in the same three-month period, toll-road bonds, as a group, have bucked this trend. juliet looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. these gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of mr. kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment.

the crowd did a mexican wave. analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts. something for the weekend sir?. whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state remedies, the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue.
