National Coat of Arms
The role of a Coat of Arms
A national coat of arms, or State emblem, is the highest visual symbol of the State. Take a minute to consider the important events in your life - birth, marriage, death and school certificates, your passport - they are all endorsed by the Coat of Arms. Your smallest coin has it on one of its sides. When away from the country seeing a plaque of it on the embassy signals a home away from home. 
The coat of arms is also a central part of the Great Seal, traditionally considered to be the highest emblem of the State. Absolute authority is given to every document with an impression of the Great Seal on it, as this means that it has been approved by the President of South Africa.
A new coat of arms, replaces one that has served South Africa since 17 September 1910. The change reflects Government's aim to highlight the democratic change in South Africa and a new sense of patriotism.
The design of the new Coat of Arms
The Coat of Arms is a series of elements organised in two distinct circles placed on top of one another.
* The lower circle represents the elements of Foundation: 
The first element is the Motto, in a green semicircle. Completing the semicircle are two symmetrically placed pairs of elephant tusks pointing upwards. Within the circle formed by the tusks are two symmetrical ears of wheat, that in turn frame a centrally placed gold shield.
The shape of the shield makes reference to the drum, and contains two human figures from Khoisan rock art. The figures are depicted facing one another in greeting and in unity.
Above the shield are placed a spear and a knobkierie, crossed in a single unit. These elements are arranged harmoniously to give focus to the shield and complete the lower circle of foundation.
* The circle of Ascendance: 
Immediately above the circle of foundation, is the visual centre of the Coat of Arms, a protea. The petals of the protea are rendered in a triangular pattern reminiscent of the crafts of Africa.
The secretary bird is placed above the protea and the flower forms the chest of the bird. The secretary bird stands with its wings uplifted in a regal and uprising gesture. The distinctive head feathers of the secretary bird crown a strong and vigilant head.
The rising sun above the horizon is placed between the wings of the secretary bird and completes the circle of ascendance. 
The combination of the upper and lower circles intersect to form an unbroken infinite course, and the great harmony between the basic elements result in a dynamic, elegant and thoroughly distinctive design. Yet it clearly retains the stability, gravity and immediacy that a Coat of Arms demands.
The symbols of the new Coat of Arms
The circle of Foundation
The Motto 
The motto is: !ke e: /xarra //ke, written in the Khoisan language of the /Xam people, literally meaning: diverse people unite. It addresses each individual effort to harness the unity between thought and action. On a collective scale it calls for the nation to unite in a common sense of belonging and national pride - Unity in Diversity.
Pronunciation of !ke e: /xarra //ke:
The ears of wheat 
An emblem of fertility, it also symbolises the idea of germination, growth and the feasible development of any potential. It relates to the nourishment of the people and signifies the agricultural aspects of the earth.
Elephant Tusks 
Elephants symbolise wisdom, strength, moderation and eternity.
The shield 
It has a dual function as a vehicle for the display of identity and of spiritual defence. It contains the primary symbol of our nation.
* The human figures 
The figures are derived from images on the Linton stone, a world famous example of South African Rock Art, now housed and displayed in the South African Museum in Cape Town. The Khoisan, the oldest known inhabitants of our land, testify to our common humanity and heritage as South Africans. The figures are depicted in an attitude of greeting, symbolising unity. This also represents the beginning of the individual's transformation into the greater sense of belonging to the nation and by extension, collective Humanity. 
* The spear and knobkierie 
Dual symbols of defence and authority, they in turn represent the powerful legs of the secretary bird. The spear and knobkierie are lying down, symbolising peace.
The circle of Ascendance
The protea 
The protea is an emblem of the beauty of our land and the flowering of our potential as a nation in pursuit of the African Renaissance. The protea symbolises the holistic integration of forces that grows from the earth and are nurtured from above. The most poplar colours of Africa have been assigned to the protea - green, gold, red and black. 
The secretary bird 
The secretary bird is characterised in flight, the natural consequence of growth and speed. It is the equivalent of the lion on earth. A powerful bird whose legs - depicted as the spear and knobkierie - serve it well in its hunt for snakes symbolising protection of the nation against its enemies. It is a messenger of the heavens and conducts its grace upon the earth, in this sense it is a symbol of divine majesty. Its uplifted wings are an emblem of the ascendance of our nation, whilst simultaneously offering us its protection. It is depicted in gold, which clearly symbolises its association with the sun and the highest power.
* The rising sun 
An emblem of brightness, splendour and the supreme principle of the nature of energy, it symbolises the promise of rebirth, the active faculties of reflection, knowledge, good judgement and willpower. It is the symbol of the source of life, of light and the ultimate wholeness of Humanity.
The completed structure of the Coat of Arms combines the lower and higher circles in a symbol of infinity. The path that connects the lower edge of the scroll, through the lines of the tusks, with the horizon above which the sun rises at the top, forms the shape of the cosmic egg from which the secretary bird rises. In the symbolic sense this is the implied rebirth of the spirit of our great and heroic nation.
The Design Process 
The Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology requested ideas for the new Coat of Arms from the public last year. Based on the ideas received, along with input from the Cabinet, a brief was written. The Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) then approached Design South Africa - an umbrella body representing design agencies across the country - to brief ten of the top designers. Three designers were chosen to present their concepts to the Cabinet. Mr Iaan Bekker's design was chosen for the new Coat of Arms. He is a director of the FCB Group and has designed numerous corporate identities for public and private sector organisations.
The new Coat of Arms enhances Batho Pele
Batho Pele is a Sesotho phrase meaning 'People First', committing the public service to serve all the people of South Africa. The Batho Pele values and principles underpin the country's coat of arms. On 1 October 1997, the public service embarked on a Batho Pele campaign aimed at improving service delivery, to the public. For this new approach to succeed some changes need to take place. Public service systems, procedures, attitudes and behaviour need to better serve its customers - the public. 
Batho Pele is a commitment to values and principles: 
* Regular consultation with customers about the quality of services provided 
* Setting service standards specifying the quality of services that customers can expect 
* Increasing access to services especially to those disadvantaged by racial, gender, geographical, social, cultural, physical, communication, and attitude related barriers 
* Ensuring higher levels of courtesy by specifying and adhering to set standards for the treatment of customers 
* Providing more and better information about services so that customers have full, accurate, relevant and up-to-date information about the services they are entitled to receive 
* Increasing openness and transparency about how services are delivered, the resources they use and who is in charge 
* Remedying failures and mistakes so that when problems occur, there is a positive response and resolution to the problem 
* Giving the best possible value for money so that customers feel their contribution to the state through taxation, is used effectively and efficiently and savings are ploughed back to further improve service delivery. 
Batho Pele is about eliminating wasteful and expensive internal systems that were not designed to put the needs of the people first. It is also about making sure that the Public Service's financial planning is in line with the public's needs and priorities.
Most of the improvements that the public would like to see cost nothing. Things such as: a smile, treating customers with respect and being honest when providing information and apologising if things go wrong. These are not a matter of additional resources - they are a matter of adopting different standards of behaviour.
Improving service delivery is about re-aligning everything we do to 'customer service' principles. The implementation of Batho Pele is not a once-off task. It is a continuous, dynamic process, that will go on for many years, gathering momentum all the time.
We need to work jointly, as the Government and the public, to make the principles of Batho Pele a reality for a nation at work for a better life.

PANSALB's POSITION ON THE PROMOTION OF MULTILINGUALISM IN SOUTH AFRICA :
 A DRAFT DISCUSSION DOCUMENT
(c) PANSALB
Pretoria, February 1998

PANSALB's position on the promotion of multilingualism in South Africa: A draft discussion document
1.	Introduction
The purpose of this document is to explain PANSALB's understanding of multilingualism and language development in the context of language legislation embodied in the Constitution and other legal documents. 

The Board's position on multilingualism is encapsulated in its mission statement below:

The mission of the Board is to promote multilingualism in South Africa by:
* creating the conditions for the development of and the equal use of all official languages
* fostering respect for and encouraging the use of other languages in the country and
* encouraging the best use of the country's linguistic resources
in order to enable South Africans to free themselves from all forms of linguistic discrimination, domination and division; and to enable them to exercise appropriate linguistic choices for their own well being as well as for national development.
2.	Guiding principles
The guiding principles for the promotion of multilingualism in South Africa are contained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996, Clauses 6(1) - (5)) and the PANSALB Act (Act 59 of 1995). 

The Constitution contains a Bill of Rights, which is mainly premised on the notion of individual rights. The language clauses should thus be understood from the orientation of language as a right. In addition, the frequency of terms such as "status", "use", "usage" point clearly towards a paradigm which is also based on the functional or instrumental use of the languages of  South Africa. The PANSALB Act, includes both these perspectives toward language, i.e. as both a right and a resource.

The purpose of the Bill of Rights is to ensure that South African society becomes one that is based on the firm democratic principle of equality. Hence, the purpose of the structures established in terms of the Constitution, is to assist in the democratisation of our society. PANSALB is one of these structures and thus its work will further democratic principles.

 The Constitution identifies two agencies responsible for effecting these, namely government and PANSALB. Under the subsection on Languages Section 6 (1-5) of the Constitution unequivocally provide that:

"1. The official languages of the Republic of South Africa are Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu.
2. : recognising the historically diminished use and status of the indegenous languages of our people, the state must take practical and positive measures to elevate the status and advance the use of these languages.
3. (a) The national and provincial governments may use any particular official languages for the purpose of government, taking into account usage, practicality, expense, regional circumstances and the balance of the needs and preferences of  the population as a whole or in the province concerned; but the national government and  each provincial government must use at least two official languages.
(b) Municipalities must take into account the language usage and preferences of their residences.
4. The national and provincial governments, by legislative and other measures, must regulate and monitor the use of official languages. Without detracting from the provisions of subsection (2), all official languages must enjoy parity of esteem and must be treated equitably.
5. A Pan South African Language Board established by  national legislation must -
(a) promote, and create conditions for the development  and use of-
I. all official languages;
II. the Khoi, Nama and San languages; and
III. sign language; and
(b) promote and ensure respect for-
I. all languages commonly used by communities in South Africa, including German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Portuguese, Tamil, Telegu and Urdu; and
II. Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit and other languages used for religious purposes in South Africa.

It is clear from the above that government's responsibilities are identified in Section 6 
(1-4), whereas PANSALB's responsibilities are spelt out in Section6 (5).

3.	Responsibilities of PANSALB
PANSALB's explicit role is to create the conditions for the development of and equal use of all official languages. This means that it must act in a manner which initiates, facilitates and empowers agencies both within state structures and civil society to contribute towards the development and use of all the official languages. 

PANSALB must promote and create the positive environment for multilingualism in general, and includes, but is not limited to, the official languages. So whilst PANSALB needs to offer advice to government on language policy and planning for advancing the status and use of the official languages, this should not detract its attention from a broader focus of facilitating the receptive environment for the promotion of multilingualism. This includes the promotion of interlinguistic skills and development of the official languages as well as other languages used in South Africa.

It is generally accepted that the best way for language development to occur is for the language to be used. Obviously every South African language has been used, some more widely than others, and most unfortunately some have been discouraged from use and are in grave danger of extinction whilst others have, in effect, become extinct. For a language to survive, it must be used for a wide range of functions otherwise it begins to wither and die. Thus, were we to have allowed higher status functions to be limited to English and Afrikaans only, the other languages of the country eventually would begin to wither and die. We have seen this happen to many of the Khoe and San languages and their extinction is a loss not only to the communities, which used them, but it is a national disaster. We have heard very little about linguistic extinction in this country whereas we are familiar with notions about the danger of certain species of plants and animals becoming extinct.  When a language dies, very often a whole body of knowledge dies with it.  Thus the task at hand is to encourage the use of the official languages as well as all other languages used in South Africa, in a wider range of contexts and for an increasing range of purposes. 

To put it plainly, we have to find the ways to ease channels of communication by insisting that our languages are used in public contexts for high level functions in order that their profiles increase and that they are heard to fulfil these functions successfully. Their use as lingua francas at local and even regional levels of economic activity needs to be publicly uncovered. Their usefulness in relation to indigenous knowledge must similarly be uncovered. 

On the other hand, the over-estimated use and reliance upon English as a lingua franca needs simultaneously to be reassessed. Whilst isiZulu functions as a lingua franca for 70% of the country's population, English can only, at present, be used efficiently by only 20% of the population. Thus, communication from government, for example, in English can only reach a minority of people who are likely to comprise the educated middle class urban dwellers.

The Board recognises that it will have to develop the most sensible strategy to recover and build on the existing functional use of African (including Afrikaans, Khoe and San and South African Sign) languages in this country. It also has to ensure that maximum advantage is taken of what English and possibly other international languages have to offer. 

In regard to our indigenous languages, a three-pronged approach needs to be followed, which simultaneously: 
* engages in the development or elaboration of these languages, and 
* explores and builds on the ways in which the users of cognate languages apply their multilingual skills to communicate. 
* creates the conditions for extending the use of these languages.

In other words, the Board will undertake development activities specific to some languages as well as initiate development strategies, which build up interlinguistic communicative skills (such as translation, interpreting, language learning programmes, etc.). Our goal is always that of maximising multilingual communicative competence rather than increasing language barriers amongst people.

While the Constitution has identified 11 languages for official status, we need to understand that this arose out of a historical situation which had previously selected ten African languages and given limited official recognition to these. The official status of nine languages1 was extended to national level, adding them to the two former official languages (Afrikaans and English). This technicality may for the foreseeable future draw anger and resentment from linguistic communities who identify strongly with a language they believe to be different from the languages which now have official status. The Board's position is that it recognises and supports the use and development of each language in South Africa because fundamentally each language and its community are resources of national importance which must be recognised, supported and harnessed. At the same time, the Board's role is to ensure that in the promotion of multilingualism, it is promoting co-operation and easing the channels the communication, not fostering linguistic competition, division or separatism. 

The Board will spell out how languages without official status should receive practical recognition and promotion. Our position is to highlight the functional use and value of each language in an interdependent relationship with others. To focus on a hierarchical configuration of languages or the "official" status of a language versus the "unofficial" status of a language will not in a practical way contribute towards an environment which nurtures multilingualism or democracy. Rather, the Board believes that in the promotion of all languages, their use and development, it will be able to support democracy and the language rights of each linguistic community. The Board notes that there is a clear constitutional obligation for government, at national and provincial level, to elevate the status and advance the use of the official languages, which were historically diminished. In order for this to happen, the state must provide the necessary resources. 

PANSALB's intention is to foster the environment in which organs of state and civil society, with an interest in language development, use and service provision, are encouraged to coexist. The common purpose would be to ensure that both language rights will be protected and the resources of each language and its users can be harnessed at all levels of society. To this end, PANSALB does not see itself in a patriarchal relationship with other language bodies; neither does it intend to become a punitive structure seeking to draw power unto itself. Rather it will continue to honour its obligation to create conditions conducive for multilingualism to flourish.
4.	Language policy orientations
The selection of multilingualism over monolingualism, together with the principle of equal status of 11 languages foregrounds the direction of language policy. Ruiz (1984 and 1988) offers a way of viewing language from three different theoretical positions, viz. language as a problem, language as a right, and language as a resource. Language planning specialists in Africa frequently refer to these views of language.  In particular, the views of language as a right and language as a resource have come under intense discussion in the Francophone and Anglophone countries of Africa. A common thread in the work of Akinasso, Bamgbose, Chumbow, Elube, Djité, Mateené, Prah and Tripathi, amongst others, is that the resources which African languages have to offer, need to be uncovered and developed in order that the people of this continent are able to take charge of their destinies.
4.1	Language as a problem 
This orientation is present in societies where the ruling ideology is segregation and or assimilation. The response to de facto multilingualism is to promote a language policy based on monolingualism, i.e. the elevation of the language of the ruling class.

South Africa is just emerging from a lengthy period of segregation and language policy based on the view that languages other than Afrikaans and English are problems.  With the emergence of the new ruling elite, language as a problem continues to prevail. However, it is manifested through assimilationist tendencies.
4.2	Language as a right 
This orientation is consistent with those societies which place store on the principles of equality. Our Constitution obliges us to develop language policy and plans from within this view. The issue of language as a right is very important, and one which has to be addressed seriously in this country, precisely because in the past, people's rights have been violated. One way of ensuring that language rights can be guaranteed is to view language from both the perspectives of language as a right and language as a resource.
4.3	Language as a resource 
This orientation is consistent with the principle of interdependence, where different communities/languages are seen to coexist interdependently. The value of each language and its speech community is acknowledged as part of the whole. Language as a resource includes the notion of language as a right. The view that each language is a resource to the nation carries with it the notion of the instrumental use of languages or functional multilingualism.
5.	The paradigm
There is no doubt that the paradigm which needs to be followed in South Africa is one which includes both the functional approach to languages which is inseparable from the view of language as a right and the view that all languages are resources.

Language policy and planning informed by these two orientations of language as a right and as a resource:
* acknowledge that there are sources of knowledge and expertise which speakers of all languages possess;
* assume that effective measures will be taken to access and harness this knowledge for the maximum advantage of society;
* unlock the potential of existing patterns of local and regional multilingual communication systems;
* utilise international systems for communication across linguistic boundaries;
* build a flexible network of multilingual communication systems to suit the domestic and international requirements of a national plan for development.
5.1	A functional approach to multilingualism
PANSALB understands functional multilingualism from a democratic, non-discriminatory perspective. It is unacceptable in South Africa for social, democratic and economic reasons to limit the use of any language. PANSALB understands this term to mean that people use different languages in different parts of the country. Therefore, it makes functional sense to use the appropriate language/s when communicating. In other words, it means that government needs to identify the appropriate medium of communication, depending on who the audience happens to be. It does not mean that government should use all 11 languages each time it communicates with the public.

To illustrate the point in a concrete manner: if the Department of Health wants to run an Aids campaign, a functional multilingual approach would rule out the idea of using one language to convey information across the country. It should disseminate this information in each of the languages used as the primary language for communication in the country, but do so in a manner which identifies the appropriate target language/s in each community. Thus the Mier district in the Northern Cape should probably receive this information in Afrikaans and possibly Nama; whereas the Willowvale area of Eastern Cape should probably receive this information in isiXhosa, and Northern KwaZulu-Natal should receive this in isiZulu. 

In terms of the broader society, if functional multilingualism were knitted into a national plan for (economic) development, it would identify when, where, which and how languages are currently used. It would evaluate the degree of efficiency of use of these languages in these contexts. It would indicate what further research is required to make better and more efficient use of languages and further it would identify which other languages could profitably facilitate this process.

Language use changes according to needs, perceived or otherwise. Consequently, the current status quo in terms of the functions of languages is unlikely to remain static even without coherent planning. However, appropriate language planning activities which are linked to national and economici development should increase the range of functions for many languages in a more systematic and ultimately beneficial manner. In so doing, it builds on the instrumental value of language, which is the best guarantee that the linguistic rights of communities are protected in an empowering manner.

An important component of functional multilingualism is that it requires responsible planning. The fear that it would automatically imply irrational multiplication of language services is based on a misunderstanding of the issue. Once the primary goal is identified, the stages and time frames along the path to reaching that goal have to be mapped out. The modernisation of those languages, which are presently prevented from functioning in domains such as international science and technology and regional and even national economies, should become an urgent priority. Language services and the publication of documents would need to be rationalised so that these become available in the languages which are most relevant to the target audience. In other words, documents need to be written in concise and plain language, and translations or summarised translations should be provided when and where the need is clearly demonstrated.
6.	Multilingualism
There are about 6000 languages used in about 200 countries which indicates that multilingualism is a global reality, although as David Crystal points out: The widespread impression that multilingualism is uncommon is promoted by government policies: less than a quarter of the world's nations give official recognition to two languages, ...and only six recognize three or more. (Crystal 1987:360) Ingrid Gogolin (1993) refers to the monolingual habitus in which the general, Western perception about language resides. The political, economic and military success of the West has resulted in a superimposing of the monolingual habitus upon the multilingual countries it subjugated. The multilingual reality which PANSALB is tasked with addressing needs to be understood against the overwhelming drive toward the monolingual habitus, and the dynamics of linguicism (linguistic racism). ( See Skutnabb-Kangas 1988)

South Africa is in a particularly unusual position in that it has more official languages at a national level than any other country. The Constitution obliges government to effect this official status and use and the Board to promote respect for other languages as well as to promote multilingualism and the development of languages in general. This obligation places South Africa at the cutting edge of international language policy development, which presents an exciting opportunity for breaking new ground internationally. 
6.1	Multilingualism in South Africa
South Africa, like most countries, is multilingual, which means that many languages are used in the country in various contexts and for various purposes. Most people are able to use more than one language; many people are able to use several languages. Many myths and misconceptions have, however, developed about languages and people who use them in this country, and it will be one of PANSALB's tasks to recover the real value and use of many languages in our country. Most of those who are multilingual speak languages which are indigenous to this country at home and in their immediate community. 

Language use across the entire continent of Africa has similarities with that in South Africa. People are motivated to learn other languages when they need to communicate for reasons, which relate to trade and economic activities. Languages used more widely or by larger speech communities tend to be used as link languages or lingua francas. There are many widely used lingua francas in Africa such as Arabic, Kiswahili, Hausa, Fulfulde, Kanuri, Kikongo, which cut across national boundaries and are used for purposes of regional trade and co-operation. 

The official indigenous languages of South Africa are similarly used as lingua francas across Southern Africa. For example: isiNdebele, is widely used in Zimbabwe and the northern parts of South Africa, and is understood by speakers of other Nguni languages (isiZulu is probably used as a lingua franca in South Africa by 70% of the population although its home language speakers constitute only 22%). Setswana predominates in Botswana as well as being spoken widely in at least two provinces of South Africa.  Xitsonga is spoken in Mozambique as well as in South Africa. Afrikaans is de facto the lingua franca of Namibia and the Northern Cape, and it functions similarly in several provinces of South Africa as well. In reality, each of South Africa's official languages is spoken or understood elsewhere in the Southern African region and hence functions as a regional lingua franca.
6.2	Monolingualism is disempowering
There is considerable movement of people using these languages across the Southern African borders for purposes of trade at local and regional levels of the economy. On the other hand, those who have been primarily engaged at the upper, national levels of economic activity, have tended to be speakers of English, and to a lesser extent Afrikaans, in this country; or speakers of French and Portuguese in other African countries. 

Colonisation brought with it various mechanisms to keep the conquered communities suppressed. One of the tools of power is language. People cannot share power if they do not have access to the language/s used by those in power. In Africa, the indigenous languages have seldom been used to challenge the colonial or neo-colonial power effectively. Along with colonisation, Western thinking, science and technology has become highly prized. The indigenous knowledge, science, medicine and local economies have, in the process, lost status and become hidden. They are hidden in the local languages, which were excluded from high-level functions by the colonial and neo-colonial rulers of the continent. Ironically, high status has been given to those who use an international language, even when they are monolingual, whereas multilingual speakers of African languages have received little recognition for their communicative gifts and considerable knowledge. The native speakers of the international languages in Africa have thus, in general, not understood the need to learn local languages. 
6.3	The value of multilingualism
The Constitution offers us an opportunity to reclaim the value of linguistic pluralism in South Africa, and in so doing to rediscover a hidden store of knowledge. This process has numerous advantages for the South African society as a whole. 

The assets of those people who have access to indigenous knowledge and language systems, including South African Sign Language, and who are multilingual, will be revalued. 

The inverse situation which has valued only those who speak English, even when they are monolingual, or who are competent only in Western science and technology, will be brought into a more balanced perspective which recognises all knowledges and communicative abilities. The perception that people who are not proficient in English are somehow deficient must be dispelled if we are to move successfully towards a democratic society where diversity is embraced and the interdependence of communities and different knowledges is cherished.

The promotion of multilingualism, furthermore, gives us the opportunity of participating more fully in the international/global community, since the spin off would lead to learning languages of wider communication for purposes of trade and international communication. For example, it should lead toward the identification of Portuguese, French, Swahili, Arabic and Hausa for trade and co-operation in Africa. 

Research conducted in this country in the 1930s and 1940s showed that bilingual people demonstrate greater social tolerance and are more likely to have academic success than monolingual people are. This research lay unnoticed for the more than half a century. It is now being supported by research conducted in other countries, such as in North America, Australia, India and Scandinavia. Thus from both socially cohesive and educational perspectives, the promotion of multilingualism is likely to have important advantages for the entire South African society.
6.4	The relationship between multilingualism and a national development plan
National language policy formulation and implementation needs to be knitted into the overall plan for national development. Scholars (see for example Tripathi 1990, Akinnaso 1991 and Siatchitema 1992) who have analysed policy and implementation processes on this continent point to the tensions which arise where, for instance, language-in-education policies do not match those of the national plan for development. What tends to happen is that the national (economic) plan usually subverts the language-in-education plan as has frequently happened in Africa, where the promotion of the use of African languages in education is undermined by the requirement of proficiency in the ex-colonial language for positions of national political and economic power. 

Several scholars on the continent also point to the link between the failure of Africa "to develop" and the implementation of Western oriented language policies, which ignore the multilingual reality of the continent (see for example Djité 1993). They also point to the link between the allocation of development aid and monolingually impelled language-in-education policies. Other countries in Africa are particularly instructive for us because ideological and or symbolic value was attached to African languages, yet the language policies have succumbed to the monolingual temptations of western development models and aid packages. Had such countries been able to acknowledge and work with the intrinsically instrumental value of African languages, the functional status of their languages might have been different.
7.	Taking stock
The PANSALB legislation is the most significant indicator that there is a commitment to articulate and monitor a language policy and plan broad enough to encompass every sector of society and it is this, which places us ahead of other countries. We have the added advantage of being able to learn from the paths chosen elsewhere on this continent. There are some basic steps, which need to be followed in articulating and implementing a feasible language policy and plan.
7.1	Language policy and planning procedures:
The following steps need to be followed for the effective implementation of a policy:
* spell out the guiding principles of a language policy as set out in the Constitution 
* extrapolate and define a language policy based on these principles;
* select the language planning paradigm which is most likely to implement these principles;
* define the boundaries;
* draw up an implementation plan which includes the participation of government and civil society;
* ensure that the language policy and plan are knitted into the national development plan;
* identify the principle obstacles along the way, and dealing with these expeditiously;
* identify target timeframes;
* adequately inform both government and civil society. 
7.2	A division of responsibilities
The Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology (DACST) has already set in motion the process of defining the outline of a national language plan. At the time that this process was begun, the Constitution of 1996, and in particular the language clauses had not been settled upon. Thus, the clear division of responsibilities was not as apparent as they are now. It becomes imperative now that both PANSALB and DACST jointly negotiate these in order to prevent duplication of functions as well as to avoid an ad hoc division of responsibilities. 

DACST has, in the meantime, initiated two essential activities, which fall squarely into government responsibility for giving effect to the equal status and use of 11 official languages:
* the mounting of an awareness campaign, scheduled for 1998-1999;
* the launching of a telephone interpreting service which would give access to people from each of the official languages, and other additional languages of priority, to emergency services.

Both of these are likely to assist government to fulfil its responsibilities and they are initiatives, which should be supported by PANSALB.

Whilst government establishes mechanisms to give effect to the equal status and use of the official languages, PANSALB's role is that of strengthening and initiating the establishment of civil society structures which support the development of interlinguistic/multilingual skills and unleashing and maximising the human resources of those who speak languages other than English. For example, PANSALB will encourage the development of:
* community and service based interpreting and translation; 
* educational materials and literature in indigenous languages which include the nine official languages, South African Sign Language, and the Khoe and San languages;
(  dictionaries which maximise access to languages within families of languages; 
* the use of local and regional lingua francas and languages of trade with our neighbours in Africa; 
* networks with neighbouring countries on language development activities with languages we share across borders;
* capacity training programmes amongst speakers/users of, especially, the indigenous languages, in language training, and development work;
* strategies and programmes which uncover indigenous knowledges of Southern Africa;
* strategies and programmes which build capacity amongst the indigenous language communities to use their languages and knowledge for their well-being.

At the end of the day, the language communities need to become empowered and need to recognise the social, educational and economic potential of their languages if multilingualism is to take root as a positive force in this country.

8.	Conclusion
Ultimately, PANSALB wants to stimulate the empowerment of language communities to recognise both the sentimental and instrumental value of their languages. Multilingualism will take root as a positive force in this country when all our languages are valued in society at large.

i "There is a fundamental relationship between language and economic development and more specifically between language and production. Alexander (1995) explains this relationship as follows:
'One of the reasons for the development of the linguistic capacity in the human species is the need which human beings have to co-operate with one another in the labour process. There are very few acts of production that human beings can perform without recourse to communication with other human beings. In this (limited and derivative) sense, language is an instrument of production, a function derived from its function as a means of communication.'
Just as language is an instrument of production it is also a tool which can be manipulated to control access to different levels of power in the labour process. The architects of apartheid, whose purpose it was to protect the elite's control of power and economic resources, understood this relationship precisely when they manipulated a language in education programme (moedertaalonderwys) to deny speakers of African languages sufficient access to the languages of economic power in this country. Under a democratic dispensation a language plan for the country will need to dismantle the components of the previous language plan and design an alternative, the principles of which are rooted in equality, democracy, and national and economic development. The implication for the broad economic sector is that points of access at all levels in the labour process must now be scrutinised against these three principles. (In Heugh 1996b)

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCING THE NATIONAL CURRICULUM STATEMENT
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996) provides the basis for curriculum
transformation and development in South Africa. The Preamble to the Constitution states that the aims
of the Constitution are to:
¡ heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and
fundamental human rights;
¡ improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person;
¡ lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the
people and every citizen is equally protected by law; and
¡ build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a sovereign
state in the family of nations.
Education and the curriculum have an important role to play in realising these aims. The curriculum aims to
develop the full potential of each learner as a citizen of a democratic South Africa.
Outcomes-based Education
Outcomes-based education forms the foundation of the curriculum in South Africa. It strives to enable all
learners to achieve to their maximum ability. This it does by setting the outcomes to be achieved at the end of
the process. The outcomes encourage a learner-centred and activity-based approach to education. The Revised
National Curriculum Statement builds its Learning Outcomes for the General Education and Training Band for
Grades R-9 (for schools) on the critical and developmental outcomes that were inspired by the Constitution and
developed in a democratic process.
The critical outcomes envisage learners who are able to:
¡ identify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and creative thinking;
¡ work effectively with others as members of a team, group, organisation and community;
¡ organise and manage themselves and their activities responsibly and effectively;
¡ collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information;
¡ communicate effectively using visual, symbolic and/or language skills in various modes;
¡ use science and technology effectively and critically, showing responsibility towards the environment and the
health of others; and
¡ demonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by recognising that problem-solving
contexts do not exist in isolation.
The developmental outcomes envisage learners who are also able to:
¡ reflect on and explore a variety of strategies to learn more effectively;
¡ participate as responsible citizens in the life of local, national, and global communities;
¡ be culturally and aesthetically sensitive across a range of social contexts;
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
Introduction

¡ explore education and career opportunities; and
¡ develop entrepreneurial opportunities.
Issues such as poverty, inequality, race, gender, age, disability and challenges such as HIV/AIDS all influence
the degree and way in which learners can participate in schooling. The Revised National Curriculum Statement
Grades R-9 (Schools) adopts an inclusive approach by specifying the minimum requirements for all learners.
All the Learning Area Statements try to create an awareness of the relationship between social justice, human
rights, a healthy environment and inclusivity. Learners are also encouraged to develop knowledge and understanding
of the rich diversity of this country, including the cultural, religious and ethnic components of this
diversity.
Revised National Curriculum Statement: Learning Area Statements
The Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) consists of an Overview and eight Learning
Area Statements for:
¡ Languages;
¡ Mathematics;
¡ Natural Sciences;
¡ Social Sciences;
¡ Arts and Culture;
¡ Life Orientation;
¡ Economic and Management Sciences; and
¡ Technology.
Each Learning Area Statement identifies the main Learning Outcomes to be achieved by the end of Grade 9.
Each Learning Area Statement also specifies the Assessment Standards that will enable the Learning Outcomes
to be achieved. Assessment Standards are defined for each grade and describe the depth and breadth of what
learners should know and be able to do. Each Learning Area Statement's Assessment Standards show how conceptual
and skill development can take place over time. Assessment Standards can be integrated within grades
as well as across grades. The achievement of an optimal relationship between integration across Learning Areas
(where necessary and educationally sound), and conceptual progression from grade to grade, are central to this
curriculum.
Revised National Curriculum Statement: Learning Programmes
The Revised National Curriculum Statement is aimed at promoting commitment as well as competence among
teachers, who will be responsible for the development of their own Learning Programmes. In order to support
this process, the Department of Education will provide policy guidelines based on each Learning Area
Statement. Provinces will develop further guidelines where necessary in order to accommodate diversity.
The underlying principles and values of the Revised National Curriculum Statement Learning Area Statements
underpin the Learning Programmes. Whereas the Learning Areas stipulate the concepts, skills and values to be
achieved on a grade by grade basis, Learning Programmes specify the scope of learning and assessment activities
for each phase. Learning Programmes also contain work schedules that provide the pace and sequence of
these activities each year, as well as exemplars of lesson plans to be implemented in any given period.
Languages - English Home Language
Introduction
3
In the Foundation Phase, there are three Learning Programmes: Literacy, Numeracy and Life Skills. In the
Intermediate Phase, Languages and Mathematics are distinct Learning Programmes. Learning Programmes must
ensure that the prescribed outcomes for each learning area are covered effectively and comprehensively. Schools
may decide on the number and nature of other Learning Programmes in the Intermediate Phase based on the
organisational imperatives of the school, provided that the national priorities and developmental needs of learners
in a phase are taken into account. In the Senior Phase, there are eight Learning Programmes based on the
Learning Area Statements. Time allocations for each Learning Area are prescribed for all Grades and Phases.
Time Allocations
In terms of Section 4 of the Employment of Educators Act, (1998), the formal school day for teachers will be
seven hours. In terms of the National Education Policy Act, (1996), the formal teaching time per school week is
35 hours. This is set out in:
(i) Overview Document ISBN 1-919917-08-X, pages 17 & 18.
(ii) Government Gazette No. 23406, Vol. 443, May 2002, pages 26 & 27
Assessment
Each Learning Area Statement includes a detailed section on assessment. An outcomes-based framework uses
assessment methods that are able to accommodate divergent contextual factors. Assessment should provide indications
of learner achievement in the most effective and efficient manner, and ensure that learners integrate and
apply skills. Assessment should also help students to make judgments about their own performance, set goals
for progress and provoke further learning.
The Kind of Teacher that is Envisaged
All teachers and other educators are key contributors to the transformation of education in South Africa. This
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) envisions teachers who are qualified, competent,
dedicated and caring. They will be able to fulfil the various roles outlined in the Norms and Standards for
Educators. These include being mediators of learning, interpreters and designers of Learning Programmes and
materials, leaders, administrators and managers, scholars, researchers and lifelong learners, community members,
citizens and pastors, assessors and Learning Area or Phase specialists.
The Kind of Learner that is Envisaged
The promotion of values is important not only for the sake of personal development, but also to ensure that a
national South African identity is built on values very different from those that underpinned apartheid education.
The kind of learner that is envisaged is one who will be inspired by these values, and who will act in the
interests of a society based on respect for democracy, equality, human dignity, life and social justice. The curriculum
seeks to create a lifelong learner who is confident and independent, literate, numerate, multi-skilled,
compassionate, with a respect for the environment and the ability to participate in society as a critical and active
citizen.

INTRODUCING THE LANGUAGES LEARNING AREA - ENGLISH
Definition
The Languages Learning Area includes:
¡ all eleven official languages: Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana,
SiSwati, Tshivenda, and Xitsonga; and
¡ languages approved by the Pan South African Language Board (PANSALB) and the South African
Certification Authority (SAFCERT) such as Braille and South African Sign Language.
The Learning Area for each official language is presented in three parts, each with its own volume: Home
Language, First Additional Language, and Second Additional Language.
In a multilingual country like South Africa it is important that learners reach high levels of proficiency in at
least two languages, and that they are able to communicate in other languages.
The Additive Approach to Multilingualism
The Languages Learning Area is in line with the Department of Education's language-in-education policy.
This policy gives School Governing Bodies the responsibility of selecting school language policies that are
appropriate for their circumstances and in line with the policy of additive multilingualism. The Languages
Learning Area Statement provides a curriculum that is supportive of whatever decision a school makes. It
follows an additive approach to multilingualism:
¡ All learners learn their home language and at least one additional official language.
¡ Learners become competent in their additional language, while their home language is maintained and
developed.
¡ All learners learn an African language for a minimum of three years by the end of the General Education
and Training Band. In some circumstances, it may be learned as a second additional language.
The home, first additional and second additional languages are approached in different ways:
¡ The home language Assessment Standards assume that learners come to school able to understand and speak
the language. They support the development of this competence, especially with regard to various types of
literacy (reading, writing, visual and critical literacies). They provide a strong curriculum to support the
language of learning and teaching.
¡ The first additional language assumes that learners do not necessarily have any knowledge of the language
when they arrive at school. The curriculum starts by developing learners' ability to understand and speak the
language. On this foundation, it builds literacy. Learners are able to transfer the literacies they have acquired
in their home language to their first additional language. The curriculum provides strong support for those
learners who will use their first additional language as a language of learning and teaching. By the end of
Grade 9, these learners should be able to use their home language and first additional language effectively
and with confidence for a variety of purposes including learning.
¡ The second additional language is intended for learners who wish to learn three languages. The third
language may be an official language or a foreign language. The Assessment Standards ensure that learners
are able to use the language for general communicative purposes. It assumes that less time will be allocated
to learning the second additional language than to the home language or first additional language.
Languages - English Home Language
Introduction
5
The Languages Learning Area covers all 11 official languages as:
¡ home languages;
¡ first additional languages; and
¡ second additional languages.
Language of Learning and Teaching
It is recommended that the learner's home language should be used for learning and teaching wherever possible.
This is particularly important in the Foundation Phase where children learn to read and write.
Where learners have to make a transition from their home language to an additional language as the language of
learning and teaching, this should be carefully planned:
¡ The additional language should be introduced as a subject in Grade 1.
¡ The home language should continue to be used alongside the additional language for as long as possible.
¡ When learners enter a school where the language of learning and teaching is an additional language for the
learner, teachers and other educators should make provision for special assistance and supplementary
learning of the additional language, until such time as the learner is able to learn effectively in the language
of learning and teaching.
Purpose
Languages are central to our lives. We communicate and understand our world through language. Language thus
shapes our identity and knowledge.
Languages serve a variety of purposes, which are reflected in the Languages Learning Area Statement. These
are:
¡ Personal - to sustain, develop and transform identities; to sustain relationships in family and community;
and for personal growth and pleasure.
¡ Communicative - to communicate appropriately and effectively in a variety of social contexts.
¡ Educational - to develop tools for thinking and reasoning, and to provide access to information.
¡ Aesthetic - to create, interpret and play imaginatively with oral, visual and written texts.
¡ Cultural - to understand and appreciate languages and cultures, and the heritage they carry.
¡ Political - to assert oneself and challenge others; to persuade others of a particular point of view; to position
oneself and others; and to sustain, develop and transform identities.
¡ Critical - to understand the relationships between language, power and identity, and to challenge uses of
these where necessary; to understand the dynamic nature of culture; and to resist persuasion and positioning
where necessary.
Unique Features and Scope
How does the Languages Learning Area contribute to the curriculum?
¡ It develops reading and writing, the foundation for other important literacies.
¡ It is the medium for much of the other learning in the curriculum, such as Mathematics and the Social
Sciences.
¡ It encourages intercultural understanding, access to other views, and a critical understanding of the concept
of culture.
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
Introduction

¡ It stimulates imaginative and creative activity, and thus promotes the goals of arts and culture.
¡ It provides a way of communicating information, and promotes many of the goals of science, technology and
environmental education.
¡ It develops the critical tools necessary to become responsible citizens.
Languages: combining knowledge, skills and values
There are six main Learning Outcomes:
¡ The first four outcomes cover five different language skills - listening, speaking, reading, viewing and
writing.
¡ Outcome 5 deals with the use of languages for thinking and reasoning, which is especially important for the
language of learning and teaching. This outcome is not included in the curriculum for second additional
languages, since its aim is not to prepare learners to use this language as a language of learning and
teaching. The Mathematics curriculum also covers the skills in this outcome to some extent.
¡ Outcome 6 deals with the core of language knowledge - sounds, words and grammar - in texts. This
knowledge is put into action through the language skills described in the other outcomes.
These outcomes have been written to give specific focus to particular kinds of knowledge and skills, and to
make them clear and understandable. When we use language, however, we integrate knowledge, skills and
values to express ourselves. A central principle of the Languages Learning Area Statement is therefore the
integration of these aspects of language through the creation and interpretation of texts.
Languages Learning Outcomes
Learning Outcome 1: Listening
The learner will be able to listen for information and enjoyment, and respond appropriately and critically
in a wide range of situations.
Learning Outcome 2: Speaking
The learner will be able to communicate confidently and effectively in spoken language in a wide range of
situations.
Learning Outcome 3: Reading and Viewing
The learner will be able to read and view for information and enjoyment, and respond critically to the
aesthetic, cultural and emotional values in texts.
Learning Outcome 4: Writing

Languages - English Home Language
Introduction

Learning Outcome 5: Thinking and Reasoning
The learner will be able to use language to think and reason, as well as to access, process and use information
for learning.
Learning Outcome 6: Language Structure and Use
The learner will know and be able to use the sounds, words and grammar of the language to create and
interpret texts.
Integration of outcomes
Listening and speaking, reading and viewing, writing, thinking and reasoning, and knowledge of sounds, words
and grammar - although presented as separate outcomes - should be integrated when taught and assessed.
For example, learners:
¡ listen to a particular kind of text (for example, a description of a process such as gold mining or paper
making);
¡ read and analyse key features of another text of the same type (for example, use of simple present tense,
passive voice, linking words such as 'first', 'next', 'then'); and
¡ design and create a new text of the same type, including visual material in the form of a flow diagram.
Creating and interpreting texts
To be able to create and interpret texts, learners need knowledge about language, knowledge about texts, and
language skills and strategies.
Texts can be:
¡ oral - for example, a speech;
¡ written - for example, a letter;
¡ a combination of written and visual - for example, an advertisement; and
¡ multimedia - for example, a film or televised text.
Knowledge of language and texts includes knowledge about:
¡ context - the purpose, topic and audience;
¡ text structure - for example, of a poem or an advertisement;
¡ language-related social practices and conventions - for example, how you greet people in different
languages;
¡ grammar, sounds and vocabulary of the language;
¡ writing and spelling in written text; and
¡ images and design in visual text.
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
Introduction

Integrating language learning: values
All texts carry values, which may be positive (for example, democratic) or negative (for example, sexist or
racist). These values are not always obvious. Learners need to become conscious and critical of the values present
in the texts they read and view, and the texts they create themselves.
When they analyse and, where necessary, challenge the values present in oral, visual and written texts, learners
will:
¡ learn how texts take a particular view of people and events;
¡ develop the critical skills to examine and, if necessary, resist these views and the values associated with
them; and
¡ become conscious of how they express values in the texts they create themselves - for example: tolerance,
empathy, respect, pleasure, humour, playfulness, displeasure, anger.
Integrating language learning: themes
Language learning can also be integrated through themes. Using a theme allows the learner to build vocabulary
related to the topic.
Careful choice of themes and topics stimulates the interest of the learner. To achieve this, teachers should try to:
¡ find a balance of topics and themes which interest boys and girls, and rural and city learners, as well as
themes which unite learners across these divisions;
¡ choose topics that are relevant to the learners' lives, and yet also move them beyond what they already know
- for example, they can learn about other countries and cultures; and
¡ select themes and topics that link with the Critical and Developmental Outcomes - for example, learners
need to engage with important human rights and environmental issues such as poverty, HIV/AIDS, the right
to land, and consumerism.
Human rights and environmental justice
Languages are an important tool for achieving human rights and environmental justice. Through its Assessment
Standards, the Languages Learning Area Statement seeks to develop this tool to its fullest potential. Learners
should become confident bilingual (or multilingual) speakers, who have the critical tools to read their world and
the texts spoken and written about it. They should be able to analyse these texts and 'rewrite' them in ways that
expand possibilities in relation to both human rights and environmental justice.

CHAPTER 2
FOUNDATION PHASE
(Grades R-3)
INTRODUCTION
All learners come to school with prior knowledge about and a high level of proficiency in their home language.
They have developed this through a variety of interactions with others in their home environment in the context of
care, nurturing and play. Because home environments differ, the knowledge children bring with them to school
also differs. However, whatever they know should be used in their language development. This is central to their
personal growth, their interactions with others, and their access to learning and the world around them. In the
next section, we briefly explain:
¡ learners' prior knowledge;
¡ environments for learning; and
¡ principles and approaches guiding this curriculum.
Focus
When learners enter Grade R or Grade 1, they have learned much through listening, and can speak with varying
degrees of fluency and confidence. They have been raised with the culture, traditions and knowledge present in
their home environment, and these are part of their language knowledge. The classroom should be a place that
celebrates, respects, and builds on what learners know.
Language Development: A Gradual Process
The principle guiding the teaching and learning of literacy in this curriculum is that language development
involves a gradual process of improving. Mistakes are a natural part of that process, and with support learners'
language will become increasingly more accurate as they have more opportunities to use and develop their
language knowledge and skills.
A Balanced Approach to Literacy Development
In this curriculum, a 'balanced approach' to literacy development has been used. It is balanced because it begins
with children's emergent literacy, it involves them in reading real books and writing for genuine purposes, and it
gives attention to phonics. These are the things learners need to know and do in order to learn to read and write
successfully. In reading, this means moving away from the 'reading readiness approach', which held that children
were not ready to start learning to read and write until they were able to perform sub-skills such as auditory
discrimination and visual discrimination, and had developed their fine and large motor skills to a certain level.
With the balanced approach, these skills:
¡ do not have to be in place before a learner can start to read and write; and
¡ can and should be developed during children's early learning experiences.
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
Foundation Phase
10
Building on Knowledge
The Languages curriculum recognises that learners begin to develop written language knowledge from the
moment they are first exposed to reading and writing at home, in the environment around them, and during their
pre-school years. To continue this process, it is necessary to make the classroom an environment that encourages
learners to become increasingly more skilled readers and writers.
Encouraging Practice
The curriculum says that it is necessary to:
¡ encourage and support learners to do wide reading;
¡ give learners frequent opportunities for writing and for developing their vocabulary and language use; and
¡ help learners to discover techniques and strategies that unlock the 'code' of the written word, for example:
 the development of various word recognition and comprehension skills such as phonemic awareness
(sensitivity to the sounds of language),
 knowledge of letter-sound correspondences (phonics), and
 knowledge of blending (the putting together of two or three letters to make a sound).
Integrating Learning Outcomes
The Learning Outcomes should be seen as working together in developing learners' language. At the beginning of
the Assessment Standards, examples of texts (oral, written or visual, and multimedia) are suggested which enable
learners and teachers to do this kind of integration. Remember: learners cannot be expected to speak a language
they have not heard, nor to write or produce texts they have never before read or seen.
Languages - English Home Language
Foundation Phase
11
LEARNING OUTCOMES
Learning Outcome 1: Listening
The learner will be able to listen for information and enjoyment, and respond appropriately and critically
in a wide range of situations.
The skills in listening that learners bring to school should be developed and used to expand their speaking, reading,
viewing and writing skills. Active listening is central to learning, as well as for building respectful relationships.
Learners can listen to increase their knowledge of their own and other languages and cultures.
Learning Outcome 2: Speaking
The learner will be able to communicate confidently and effectively in spoken language in a wide range of
situations.
Learners need to be able to use their communication skills effectively across cultural and language boundaries.
They should learn through experience that multilingualism is personally and socially enriching. They should learn
how to communicate with people who have speech and hearing impairments, and to be sensitive to their needs.
Learning Outcome 3: Reading and Viewing
The learner will be able to read and view for information and enjoyment, and respond critically to the
aesthetic, cultural and emotional values in texts.
Reading for meaning is the main purpose. Techniques and strategies that help learners do this with increasing
accuracy support reading for meaning. Reading (including visual and multimedia texts) is essential for language
development, learning to write, enjoyment, personal growth, and learning about the world.
Learning Outcome 4: Writing
The learner will be able to write different kinds of factual and imaginative texts for a wide range of
purposes.
In the Foundation Phase, learners work towards this outcome. They learn that writing carries meaning, and that
they themselves are the authors of that meaning. They develop their handwriting skills to be able to record their
thoughts and ideas so that they and others can read them. They learn how to use writing conventions such as
spelling and punctuation to make their writing understandable to others. They learn that writing is a process that
includes pre-writing, drafting, revising, editing, illustrating and publishing.
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
Foundation Phase
12
Learning Outcome 5: Thinking and Reasoning
The learner will be able to use language to think and reason, as well as to access, process and use information
for learning.
The skills outlined in this outcome are part of all aspects of language learning. The reason for including them in a
separate Learning Outcome is to highlight their importance in developing language across the curriculum.
Languages can be described as a 'gateway' learning area: they make it possible for children to learn all their other
subjects. Therefore, teachers consistently need to develop, reinforce and consolidate the language tools for thinking
and reasoning. This should not be done in isolation - learners need to apply these skills in all Learning Areas.
Learning Outcome 6: Language Structure and Use
The learner will know and be able to use the sounds, words and grammar of the language to create and
interpret texts.
Learners will begin to explore how language works. They will start to develop a shared language for talking
about language (a 'meta-language'). For example, they will learn and use terms like 'sound', 'syllable', 'word',
'sentence' and 'full stop'. This will enable them to discuss and think about such things as how words are spelled
and how simple sentences are structured and punctuated.
ASSESSMENT STANDARDS AND TEXTS
Notes:
¡ In the next sections, the Assessment Standards for each Learning Outcome will be given for each grade.
Examples are given of texts that can be used for integrated language learning. These are not the only possible
examples, and the teacher can add to them by choosing any other suitable and available texts.
¡ Teachers need to remember that not all learners will have attended Grade R. Concepts, skills and strategies for
Grade R need to be taught and consolidated in Grade 1.

CHAPTER 3
INTERMEDIATE PHASE
(Grades 4-6)
INTRODUCTION
In the Intermediate Phase, learners are moving into adolescence. They are energetic, responsive to peer influence,
often restless and unsure about themselves. They are self-conscious and curious about who they are and who they
want to be. Issues relating to identity become increasingly important, and it is necessary to keep in mind the relationship
between language and identity in our multilingual and multicultural country. Some of the characteristics
of learners in this phase are:
¡ They become more sensitive to how their actions affect others.
¡ They begin to consider the needs, desires and points of view of others.
¡ They begin to function co-operatively in group tasks with increasing ease.
¡ They begin to enjoy the challenge of tackling independent tasks.
¡ They show the desire to take control of their own learning.
¡ They become more deliberate and methodical in their approach.
¡ They become increasingly able to access, record and manipulate information.
¡ They are increasingly able to investigate, compare and assess critically.
Focus
In this phase, learners consolidate and extend their literacy skills, and build their confidence and fluency in using
oral language. Cross-curricular work will form an important part of learning activities.
Wider Range of Texts
Learners will work with a wider range of texts than in the Foundation Phase. The language and content of texts
will be longer and more complex. They will introduce learners to oral and written literature, and to important
social and environmental issues.
Integrated Learning Activities
To help set clear Assessment Standards, each outcome has a different skill or skills as its focus (listening, speaking,
reading and viewing, writing, thinking and reasoning, language structure and use). However, in learning programmes
these should be contextualised in integrated learning activities with clear and relevant purposes.
Broader and Varied Content
Relevant content should be drawn from a wide variety of issues, based on the learners' individual needs and on
broader social issues. Try to cover national concerns such as poverty, HIV/AIDS and crime. These issues should
not be treated just as the content of texts, but rather as a conscious part of the learning experience. In this way,
learners can be exposed to authentic use of language, enabling them to develop critical skills, for example:
¡ recognising stereotypes;
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
56
Intermediate Phase
¡ learning how texts persuade readers to particular points of view; and
¡ challenging these uses of language.
Through this approach, teachers and learners will:
¡ achieve the twelve Critical and Developmental Outcomes; and
¡ prepare for more complex activities and demanding Assessment Standards in the Senior Phase.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
Learning Outcome 1: Listening
The learner will be able to listen for information and enjoyment, and respond appropriately and critically
in a wide range of situations.
Learners' listening skills are refined to enable them to listen to extended oral texts (both formal and informal) for
different purposes.
Learning Outcome 2: Speaking
The learner will be able to communicate confidently and effectively in spoken language in a wide range of
situations.
As learners grow, situations become more challenging and demand more confidence and effectiveness in speaking.
Learners will continue to develop their communication skills, become sensitive to cultural differences, and
learn to value multilingualism.
Learning Outcome 3: Reading and Viewing
The learner will be able to read and view for information and enjoyment, and respond critically to the aesthetic,
cultural and emotional values in texts.
Reading of South African and international fiction and non-fiction is necessary for learners' emotional and personal
growth, for language development, for literacy, for understanding of values, and for enjoyment.
Learning Outcome 4: Writing
The learner will be able to write different kinds of factual and imaginative texts for a wide range of purposes.
Learners continue to develop their writing skills for different purposes and audiences. They begin to develop and
organise ideas appropriately in factual and creative texts by following the steps in the writing process.
Languages - English Home Language
57
Intermediate Phase
Learning Outcome 5: Thinking and Reasoning
The learner will be able to use language to think and reason, as well as to access, process and use
information for learning.
More developed thinking skills, including 'thinking about their thinking' (meta-cognition) and information
literacy are important for cross-curricular work and for educational success. They should be taught in an
integrated way in the context of problem-solving activities with a clear and valuable educational purpose.
Learning Outcome 6: Language Structure and Use
The learner will know and be able to use the sounds, words and grammar of the language to create and
interpret texts.
Learners will explore how language works, and develop a shared language for talking about language (a 'metalanguage'),
so that they can evaluate their own and other texts critically in terms of meaning, effectiveness and
accuracy. They will also be able to use this knowledge to experiment with language to build meaning (from word
and sentence levels to whole texts), and see how a text and its context are related. They will become aware of how
language changes over time and between cultures, and how it changes in different situations.
ASSESSMENT STANDARDS AND TEXTS
In the next sections, the Assessment Standards for each Learning Outcome will be given for each Grade.
Examples are given of texts that can be used for integrated language learning. These are not the only possible
examples, and the teacher can add to them by choosing any other suitable and available texts.

CHAPTER 4
SENIOR PHASE
(Grades 7-9)
INTRODUCTION
In this phase, learners are consolidating what they have learned in earlier grades, and preparing for further education
and the world of work. They are preparing to become active participants in a democratic society, to
engage critically with social and environmental issues such as HIV/AIDS, and to act in constructive ways. They
need to use language for personal, public, formal and educational purposes.
Through language, learners should be informed about:
¡ career and further learning opportunities; and
¡ their rights and responsibilities as citizens in a democratic, multicultural society.
Focus
The focus of this phase is on consolidation and extension of language and literacy. By the end of Grade 9, learners
should be:
¡ able to read and write for a wide range of purposes - formal and informal, public and personal;
¡ keen, flexible readers who can find and evaluate information for themselves;
¡ active, critical listeners and confident speakers of the language, sensitive to their audience; and
¡ able to analyse language, understand how it works, and use it for their own purposes.
LEARNING OUTCOMES
Learning Outcome 1: Listening
The learner will be able to listen for information and enjoyment, and respond appropriately and critically
in a wide range of situations.
Learners will listen actively, empathetically and critically to a wide range of oral texts, and summarise, record
and respond to them.
Learning Outcome 2: Speaking
The learner will be able to communicate confidently and effectively in spoken language in a wide range of
situations.
Learners will speak confidently in public, and communicate appropriately and effectively with others. This is
necessary for work and further education.
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
92
Senior Phase
Learning Outcome 3: Reading and Viewing
The learner will be able to read and view for information and enjoyment, and respond critically to the
aesthetic, cultural and emotional values in texts.
Reading is the foundation for writing and a means of lifelong learning. Learners should read a variety of texts,
including South African and international fiction and non-fiction. This will support the development of learners'
language, general knowledge and personal growth.
Learning Outcome 4: Writing
The learner will be able to write different kinds of factual and imaginative texts for a wide range of
purposes.
Writing is both a means of reflection and of learning, as well as a mode of communication. It is often the mode
for assessing learners, and it is therefore very important for further education and employment.
Learning Outcome 5: Thinking and Reasoning
The learner will be able to use language to think and reason, as well as to access, process and use
information for learning.
More developed thinking skills and information literacy are the gateway to lifelong learning and achievement of
the Critical and Developmental Outcomes.
Learning Outcome 6: Language Structure and Use
The learner will know and be able to use the sounds, words and grammar of the language to create and
interpret texts.
Learners will explore how language works, and develop a shared language for talking about language (a 'metalanguage'),
so that they can evaluate their own and other texts critically in terms of meaning, effectiveness and
accuracy. They will also be able to use this knowledge to experiment with language to build meaning (from
word and sentence levels to whole texts), and to see how a text and its context are related. They will become
aware of how language changes over time and between cultures, and how it changes in different situations.

ASSESSMENT STANDARDS AND TEXTS
In the next sections, the Assessment Standards for each Learning Outcome will be given for each Grade.
Examples are given of texts that can be used for integrated language learning. These are not the only possible
examples, and the teacher can add to them by choosing any other suitable and available texts.

¡ texts that use images and writing (and other means of communication) in their design (multi-modal texts);
¡ texts that enable learners to explore popular culture and the media;
¡ a variety of language use and issues:
 the way language constructs meaning - a writer adopts a point a view and positions readers to make
meaning in particular ways,
 the way readers make meaning out of text, and how they bring their experience and values to the text,
 ways of responding to text that make use of a critical understanding of the construction and interpretation
of texts (e.g. to resist consumerist, sexist or racist messages),
 language variety: varieties related to region (dialects), age group (slang), etc., as well as the influences of
languages on one another.

CHAPTER 5
LEARNER ASSESSMENT
INTRODUCTION
The assessment framework of the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) is based on the
principles of outcomes-based education. Assessment should provide indications of learner achievement in the
most effective and efficient manner, and ensure that learners integrate and apply knowledge and skills.
Assessment should also help students to make judgements about their own performance, set goals for progress
and provoke further learning.
To assist in the process of learner assessment, this Revised National Curriculum Statement:
¡ outlines the Learning Outcomes and their associated Assessment Standards in each Learning Area and for
each grade in the General Education and Training Band (Grades R-9);
¡ contextualises the Critical and Developmental Outcomes within the Learning Outcomes and Assessment
Standards; and
¡ places Assessment Standards at the heart of the assessment process in every grade. Assessment Standards
describe the level at which learners should demonstrate their achievement of the Learning Outcome(s) and
the ways (depth and breadth) of demonstrating their achievement.
The following diagram illustrates the interaction between the design elements of this Revised National
Curriculum Statement:
ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES USED IN OUTCOMES-BASED EDUCATION
Definition
Assessment in the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) is a continuous, planned
process of gathering information about the performance of learners measured against the Assessment Standards
of the Learning Outcomes. It requires clearly-defined criteria and a variety of appropriate strategies to enable
teachers to give constructive feedback to learners and to report to parents and other interested people.

Learner Assessment
Key Elements
Outcomes-based education is a way of teaching and learning which makes it clear what learners are expected to
achieve. The principle by which it works is that the teacher states beforehand what the learners are expected to
achieve. The teacher's task is to teach in order to help learners to satisfy the requirements of the Assessment
Standards in the curriculum; the learners' task is to learn or do what the Assessment Standards expect.
Assessment is essential to outcomes-based education because it must be possible to assess when a learner has
achieved what is required in each grade.
To help learners to reach their full potential, assessment should be:
¡ transparent and clearly focused;
¡ integrated with teaching and learning;
¡ based on predetermined criteria or standards;
¡ varied in terms of methods and contexts; and
¡ valid, reliable, fair, learner-paced, and flexible enough to allow for expanded opportunities.
Purposes of Assessment
The main purpose of assessing learners should be to enhance individual growth and development, to monitor
the progress of learners and to facilitate their learning. Other uses of assessment include:
¡ baseline assessment of prior learning
Baseline assessment usually takes place at the beginning of a grade or phase to establish what learners
already know. It assists teachers to plan learning programmes and learning activities.
¡ diagnostic assessment
Diagnostic assessment is used to find out about the nature and cause of barriers to learning experienced by
specific learners. It is followed by guidance, appropriate support and intervention strategies.
¡ formative assessment
Formative assessment monitors and supports the process of learning and teaching, and is used to inform
learners and teachers about learners' progress so as to improve learning. Constructive feedback is given to
enable learners to grow.
¡ summative assessment
Summative assessment gives an overall picture of learners' progress at a given time, for example, at the end
of a term or year, or on transfer to another school.
¡ systemic assessment
Systemic assessment is a way of monitoring the performance of the education system. One component of
this is the assessment of learner performance in relation to national indicators. Systemic assessment is conducted
at the end of each phase of the General Education and Training Band. A representative sample of
schools and learners is selected provincially or nationally for systemic assessment.

Learner Assessment
CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT
Characteristics of Continuous Assessment
Continuous assessment is the chief method by which assessment takes place in the Revised National Curriculum
Statement. It covers all the outcomes-based education assessment principles and ensures that assessment:
¡ takes place over a period of time and is ongoing: Learning is assessed regularly and the records of learners'
progress are updated throughout the year.
¡ supports the growth and development of learners: Learners become active participants in learning and
assessment, understand the criteria that are used for assessment activities, are involved in self-evaluation, set
individual targets for themselves, reflect on their learning, and thereby experience raised self-esteem.
¡ provides feedback from learning and teaching: Feedback is a crucial element in formative assessment.
Methods of feedback include appropriate questioning, focusing the teacher's oral and written comments on
what was intended to be achieved by an assessment activity, and encouragement to a learner.
¡ allows for the integrated assessment: This may include assessing a number of related Learning Outcomes
within a single activity, and combining a number of different assessment methods. Competence in particular
Learning Outcomes can be demonstrated in many different ways, and thus a variety of assessment methods
and opportunities must be provided through which learners can demonstrate their ability.
¡ uses strategies that cater for a variety of learner needs (language, physical, psychological, emotional and
cultural): Continuous assessment allows teachers to be sensitive to learners with special education needs and
to overcome barriers to learning through flexible approaches. In any group of learners, there are different
rates and styles of learning. All learners do not need to be assessed at the same time and in the same way.
¡ allows for summative assessment: The accumulation of the results of continuous assessment activities provides
an overall picture of a learner's progress at a given time. Summative assessment needs to be planned
carefully from the beginning of the year, to include a variety of assessment strategies - for example, exercises,
tasks, projects, school and class tests - which will provide learners with a range of opportunities to show
what they have learned.
Assessment Strategies
The choice of what assessment strategies to use is a subjective one, unique to each teacher, grade and school,
and dependent on the teacher's professional judgement. The availability of space and resources influences this
decision, but even when resources are similar, teachers differ in the way that they make their choices.
The methods chosen for assessment activities must be appropriate to the Assessment Standards to be assessed,
and the purpose of the assessment must be clearly understood by all the learners and teachers involved.
Competence can be demonstrated in a number of ways. Thus a variety of methods is needed to demonstrate
their abilities more fully.
Common Tasks for Assessment
The purpose of Common Tasks for Assessment is to:
¡ ensure consistency in teacher judgements;
¡ promote common standard setting;
¡ strengthen the capacity for school-based continuous assessment;
¡ increase the accuracy of the assessment process and tools;
¡ ensure that the school-based assessment tasks properly assess competencies and achievements; and
¡ ensure expanded opportunities for learners.
Common Tasks for Assessment may be set at national, provincial, district or cluster level, are conducted at
school level, and are moderated externally
MANAGING ASSESSMENT
People Involved in Assessment
The school and the teachers have overall responsibility for the assessment of learners. Teachers are expected to
create a valid, reliable and credible assessment process. Provincial policies should ensure the involvement of
learners, school assessment teams, district support teams, support services, and parents, as appropriate.
School Assessment Programme
Each school must develop an assessment programme based on provincial and national assessment guidelines. It
needs to have a School Assessment Plan and a team to facilitate the implementation of this programme. The
team should have representatives from each Phase and Learning Area.
To ensure a professional approach to assessment, the school assessment programme must outline clearly:
¡ the way continuous assessment is planned and implemented;
¡ how record books are to be kept, their accessibility and security;
¡ the assessment codes determined by the province;
¡ internal verification of assessment;
¡ how moderation takes place in the school;
¡ the frequency and method of reporting;
¡ the monitoring of all assessment processes; and
¡ the training of staff in areas of assessment.
Areas where in-school training needs to take place include:
¡ how to use criteria/rubrics to assess;
¡ finding agreement between teachers in the same grade about what is considered necessary to satisfy the
Learning Outcomes;
¡ how to write comments for assessment results and reports; and
¡ achieving a common understanding of the school's assessment programme.

KEEPING RECORDS
Record Books
Good record keeping is essential in all assessment, particularly in continuous assessment. A record book or file
must be kept up to date by each teacher. It should contain:
¡ learners' names;
¡ dates of assessment;
¡ name and description of the assessment activity;
¡ the results of assessment activities, according to Learning Areas or Learning Programmes; and
¡ comments for support purposes.
All records must be accessible, easy to interpret, securely kept, confidential and helpful in the teaching and
reporting process.
The school assessment programme determines the details of how record books must be completed. The assessment
codes are used to express how the learner is performing against the Learning Outcomes. Codes used must
be clear and understood by learners and parents.
Codes to Use for Assessment
There are many ways in which feedback from assessment can be provided to learners and recorded by teachers.
Choosing the best way to do so for an assessment activity will depend on a number of factors, such as:
¡ the number of learners in the class and the amount of time available to the teacher;
¡ the complexity and the length of the assessment activity;
¡ the learning content or skills being assessed (e.g. Mathematics or writing);
¡ how quickly feedback is given;
¡ how individualised the feedback is;
¡ the criteria (or rubrics) used by the teacher to describe learners' performance; and
¡ whether learners' performance is to be compared to peers, to previous performance, and/or the requirements
of the Assessment Standards and Learning Outcomes.
Some assessment codes are better for some purposes than for others. For example, comments can be detailed,
individual and provide suggestions for improvement. Comments are also useful for reporting on learner performance
against Assessment Standards. However, comments take long to write and are not very easy to record.
Codes such as 'Excellent', 'Very Good', 'Good', 'Competent', and 'Insufficient' are much quicker to write and
allow assessment of progress against previous work and against Assessment Standards. However, they do not
provide the detail made possible by comments. Marks, on the other hand, are quickly recorded and can be added
together, multiplied and divided. They are useful for assessing learners' performance in relation to others in the
class, and to other grades or schools. However, they provide little information on learners' performance against
the Assessment Standards.
Examples, among many others, of further assessment codes are:
¡ not yet achieved, almost there, achieved;
¡ satisfactory performance, needs support;
¡ A, B, C; and
¡ phrases (or rubrics) designed especially for the assessment activity or report.
Whatever assessment code is used, feedback is more effective when combined with comments. There is more
likely to be an improvement in achievement when learners are given written feedback rather than marks only.
Although marks and percentages are very useful for recording purposes, as it is easy to write marks into a
record book, they are often not useful for feedback and reporting. Other problems presented by marks are that
they can be aggregated and manipulated and that they hide much about learners' achievement and progress. If
learners have completed more than one assessment activity there is a temptation to use the marks arithmetically,
to add and to average. When this is done, marks lose their usefulness to feed back information. An average or
aggregate mark hides the fact that a learner might have achieved the intended learning well in one aspect but
not in another.
Marks give an overall impression of achievement but hide the reasons for the assessment of the achievement
(or lack of achievement) from the learner, and prevent a focus on learning something from the assessment.
They also do not describe learner progress in the curriculum well. In many cases maintaining the same mark
(provided it is a satisfactory one) is regarded as an indication of good progress. A mark of 70 against the Grade
5 Assessment Standards and a mark of 70 against the Grade 6 Assessment Standards disguises completely the
progress a learner might have made during the year, which is best described in a statement, code, or
comment(s).
National Codes
In recording or reporting on learner achievement in the Learning Outcomes specific to a grade, the following
codes are to be used:
4 = Learner's performance has exceeded the requirements of the Learning Outcome for the grade.
3 = Learner's performance has satisfied the requirements of the Learning Outcome for the grade.
2 = Learner's performance has partially satisfied the requirements of the Learning Outcome for the grade.
1 = Learner's performance has not satisfied the requirements of the Learning Outcome for the grade.
Progression Schedules
At the end of each year, a progression schedule must be completed, and signed by the principal and a departmental
official. The progression schedule is a record with summary information about the progress of all learners
in the grade in the school.
The progression schedule should include the following information:
¡ name of the school and school stamp;
¡ list of learners in each grade;
¡ codes for progress in each Learning Area (National Coding System);
¡ codes for progress in each grade (progress to the next grade or stay in the same grade);

Languages - English Home Language

¡ comments on strengths and areas for support in each Learning Area; and
¡ date and signature of principal, teacher or other educator, and departmental official.
Learner Profiles
A learner profile is a continuous record of information that gives an all-round impression of a learner's
progress, including the holistic development of values, attitudes and social development. It assists the teacher in
the next grade or school to understand the learner better, and therefore to respond appropriately to the learner.
The profile must be safeguarded for every learner and should accompany learners throughout their school
careers.
The following kinds of information should be included in a learner profile:
¡ personal information;
¡ physical condition and medical history;
¡ schools attended and record of attendance;
¡ participation and achievements in extra-curricular activities;
¡ emotional and social behaviour;
¡ parental involvement;
¡ areas needing additional support;
¡ summative end-of-year overall report; and
¡ progression summary records of the schooling years.
Notes:
¡ The learner profile replaces all previous continuous record documents that have been used by schools, such
as record cards, tutor cards and Edlab cards. The central purpose of a learner profile is to assist the learner
by having access to the variety of information it includes.
¡ Personal information in a profile should never be used to discriminate unfairly against a learner.
¡ Learner profiles should not be confused with portfolios. A portfolio is a method of assessment that gives the
learner and teacher together an opportunity to consider work done for a number of assessment activities. The
work is placed in a folder, file or box. The learner profile, on the other hand, is a record containing information
about a learner.
REPORTS
Information to be Included in Reports
Teachers need to be accountable to learners, parents, the education system and the broader community in assessing
their learners. This takes place through reporting. In addition to written reports, oral or practical presentations,
displays of learners' work and exhibitions might be used.
Every report on a learner's overall progress should include information on:
¡ the learning achieved;
¡ the learner's competencies;
¡ support needed; and
Learner Assessment
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
132
Learner Assessment
¡ constructive feedback, which should contain comments about the learner's performance in relation to peers
and the learner's previous performance in relation to the requirements of the Learning Areas.
Reporting to parents should be done on a regular basis to encourage their involvement and participation.
Teachers must report at the end of each term using formal report cards.
It will usually not be possible to give information on achievement in each Learning Outcome. However, reports
should give information on achievement in each of the Learning Areas or Learning Programmes (in the case of
the Foundation Phase).
Report Cards
The minimum requirements for a report card are:
1) Basic information
¡ name of school;
¡ name of learner;
¡ grade of learner;
¡ date of birth of learner;
¡ year and term;
¡ date and signature of parent or guardian;
¡ date and signature of teacher;
¡ date and signature of principal;
¡ dates of closing and opening of school;
¡ school stamp;
¡ school attendance profile; and
¡ the explanation of the codes of the national coding system.
2) Strengths and needs
¡ Give a description of the strengths, developmental needs, or areas of support required by the learner in each
Learning Area or Learning Programme.
¡ Use the national coding system to evaluate performance against the Assessment Standards and the Learning
Outcomes covered thus far - it is not necessary to give a code for each Learning Outcome. In an end of year
report, the overall performance of the learner in the Learning Areas must be shown.
3) Comments on each Learning Area or Learning Programme
¡ Give comments on each Learning Area or Learning Programme, with special emphasis on students who have
exceeded the requirements or need further support. Comments on specific strengths and areas of support
should be linked to the Assessment Standards. These comments will allow parents, learners and other educators
to gain an understanding of what support the learner needs.

CURRICULUM AND ASSESSMENT GLOSSARY
This is an alphabetical list of key terms used in designing the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades
R-9 (Schools) and its learner assessment principles.
assessment - a continuous planned process of gathering information on learner performance, measured against
the Assessment Standards
Assessment Standards - the knowledge, skills and values that learners need to show to achieve the Learning
Outcomes in each grade
baseline assessment - initial assessment used to find out what learners already know
continuous assessment - assessment model that encourages integration of assessment into teaching and the
development of learners through ongoing feedback
critical outcomes - together with the Developmental Outcomes, key outcomes of Revised National Curriculum
Statement Grades R-9 (Schools), that are inspired by the Constitution; they include core life skills for learners,
such as communication, critical thinking, activity and information management, group and community work,
and evaluation skills
Curriculum 2005 - the first version of the post-apartheid National Curriculum Statement. That 1997 education
policy document gives a framework for Early Childhood Development, General Education and Training, Further
Education and Training, and Adult Basic Education and Training. This Revised National Curriculum Statement
Grades R-9 (Schools) aims to strengthen Curriculum 2005.
developmental outcomes - together with the Critical Outcomes, key outcomes of the Revised National
Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) that are inspired by the Constitution; they include enabling learners
to learn effectively and to become responsible, sensitive and productive citizens
exit-level - when learners complete Grade 9 and are awarded the General Education and Training Certificate
formative assessment - a form of assessment that assesses learner progress during the learning process in
order to provide feedback that will strengthen learning
Foundation Phase - the first phase of the General Education and Training Band: Grades R, 1, 2 and 3
General Education and Training Band - the ten compulsory schooling years, made up of the Foundation,
Intermediate and Senior Phases
Languages - English Home Language
135
Reference Lists
General Education and Training Certificate - the certificate obtained on successful completion of the General
Education and Training Band
integration - a key design principle of the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools), that
requires learners to use their knowledge and skills from other Learning Areas, or from different parts of the
same Learning Area, to carry out tasks and activities
Intermediate Phase - the second phase of the General Education and Training Band: Grades 4, 5 and 6
language of learning and teaching - the language that is most used in a particular learning and teaching environment;
some learners experience learning and teaching in an additional language (not their home language).
learning areas - the eight fields of knowledge in the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9
(Schools): Languages, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Technology, Social Sciences, Arts and Culture, Life
Orientation, and Economic and Management Sciences

guided by the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) but developed by provinces,
schools and teachers
national coding system - a standard national system of performance codes used to report on a learner's
progress
outcomes - the results at the end of the learning process in outcomes-based education; these outcomes help
shape the learning process

Reference Lists
summative assessment - different from formative assessment, as it is about regular reports of a learner's
progress, usually at the end of the term or year
LANGUAGES LEARNING AREA GLOSSARY
active listening - when a person tries to put themselves in the place of the speaker and listens seriously to what
he or she has to say
additional language - a language learned in addition to one's home language
additive multilingualism - when a person learns a language (or languages) in addition to his or her home language.
This does not replace the home language but is learned alongside it.
aesthetic - the use of language to create something fine and pleasurable
allegory, allegorical - An allegory is a story in which the characters and actions represent general truths and
good and bad qualities. Allegorical language is language in which characters and actions are used to make
moral points.
alliteration - the repeated use of the same sound at the beginning of words in a sequence (e.g. round the rocks
the ragged rascal ran)
antonym - a word that is opposite in meaning to another word in the same language (e.g. 'tall' and 'short' are
antonyms in English)
assessment standards - the language knowledge, skills and values that learners must be able to demonstrate
they know or can do by the end of a particular grade
audience - the person or persons who will listen to, read or view a particular text (e.g. the audience for a radio
talk show, a newspaper article or a television advertisement)
auditory discrimination - the ability to distinguish between the separate sounds of a language
authentic texts - texts which are used in the real world (e.g. magazine and newspaper articles, recordings from
radio and television, advertisements, labels from packets, brochures, forms, letters)
balanced approach to literacy - an approach which supports learners' emergent literacy (see entry below),
which encourages learners to enjoy books and to focus on meaning, and which also gives them the techniques
and strategies to unlock the code of the written word
bias - a tendency to favour one thing over another so that one is unable to make a fair assessment
blends, blending - an aspect of phonics in which children learn how to put together two or three letters to make
a sound (e.g. 'spr' in 'spread')
Languages - English Home Language

Reference Lists
cliché - an expression or an idea that has been used so often it has lost its expressive power (e.g. 'the rainbow
nation')
climax - the most exciting, effective or important part of a story, which usually comes near the end
code-switching - switching from one language to another for a purpose (e.g. to include others, to show that one
is together with the people one is speaking to)
coherent - something which makes logical sense. A coherent paragraph is one in which there is a clear development
of ideas, and in which sentences have clear logical links.
cohesive - cohesive devices link sentences together in a paragraph or text and give it unity. They can be pronouns
or words which repeat the content in different ways (e.g. 'Gold is mined in South Africa. It is one of the
country's main exports.')
collocation - works that typically go together or that cluster around the same topic or subject matter (e.g. 'salt
and pepper'; 'strong coffee' but not 'powerful coffee')
conjunction - a word used to join two clauses in a sentence (e.g. 'and', 'but', 'so')
connotative meaning - the meanings which a word suggests (e.g. 'plump' has positive connotations such as
attractive, comfortable, cheerful; whereas 'fat' has more negative connotations)
consonant cluster - consonants which occur together in consistent patterns in a language (e.g. in English 'str'
as in 'strange', 'strip' and 'struggle')
context - a text is always produced and received in a context. The context includes the broad and the immediate
situation. The text must be appropriate to both kinds of context.
denotative meaning - the literal or straightforward meaning of a word
diagraph - two letters used to refer to a single sound. In English there are consonant diagraphs (e.g. 'th', 'sh')
and vowel diagraphs (e.g. 'ea', 'ee')
directionality - the fact that in English we read from left to right, and when we come to the end of a row of
print, we must begin on the left-hand side again. This is something that children have to learn.
emergent literacy - refers to a child's growing knowledge of the printed word. Children see print in the environment
and begin to understand its purpose. They may have stories told or read to them and they learn how
stories work and what books are. So even before they come to school they often know a lot. They may try to
write their names using their own ideas about letters and spelling (i.e. emergent spelling), and they may pretend
to read a book (i.e. reading-like behaviour). This is the beginning of children's literacy.
emotive language - language which arouses strong feelings
Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools)
138

empathy, empathetically - an ability to imagine oneself in another person's place, to do something with empathy
enunciate, enunciation - to pronounce words carefully and clearly
expository text - text which involves explanation
foreign language - a language spoken beyond the borders of South Africa (e.g. French)
formulaic language - language which is learned in chunks (e.g. greetings). It often relates to specific contexts
(e.g. ordering a meal in a restaurant). When we begin to learn a language, much of what we learn is of this kind.
Gradually, we begin to make sense of the patterns and rules of the language, and we become able to express our
own ideas in very simple ways.
frame - a temporary support (or scaffolding) for writing or speaking; for example, the teacher could provide the
following frame for a poem:
Red is the colour of anger
Red is the colour of blood
Red is the colour of danger
Red is the colour of love
----- is the colour of -----
----- is the colour of -----
----- is the colour of -----
----- is the colour of -----
free writing - when learners are given the freedom to write whatever they like without worrying about mistakes.
Learners should be encouraged to write as much as possible.
graded readers - books which are written with grammar and vocabulary at different levels (e.g. 500 word
level, 1000 word level). They enable learners to read at a level appropriate to their language knowledge.
holistic - approaches to language which integrate all the skills and various kinds of knowledge in activities and
do not focus on each in turn
home language - the language which children learn through being immersed in it in their home and/or community.
More than one language can be learned in this way, so learners can have more than one home language.
homonym - a word which has both the same sound and spelling as another but has a different meaning (e.g. the
noun 'bear' and the verb 'to bear')
homophone - a word which sounds the same as another but is spelled differently and has a different meaning
(e.g. 'one' and 'won')

hyperbole - an exaggeration (e.g. to describe something so that it appears bigger than it really is - for example,
'He gave me a mountainous plate of food.')
image - a picture or visual representation of something
imagery - words which create images in our minds (e.g. similes, metaphors, personification)
infer - to read between the lines to form an opinion about something
innuendo - something unpleasant which is suggested rather than explicitly stated
intonation - a pattern of rise and fall in the pitch of one's voice which contributes to the meaning of sentences
(e.g. questions are spoken with a rising intonation)
irony - something which is the opposite of what is expected; using words to mean the opposite of what is
expected
literacy - the ability to read and use written information and to write for different purposes. It is part of a general
ability to make sense of one's world.
literacies - There are various kinds of literacy: reading and writing; cultural literacy (understanding the cultural,
social and ideological values that shape our reading of texts); critical literacy (the ability to respond critically to
the messages in texts); visual literacy (the reading/writing of images, signs, pictures, etc.); media literacy (the
reading of newspapers, magazines, television and film as cultural messages).
meta-language - a language used to talk about language. It includes terminology such as 'sound', 'word', 'sentence',
'text', 'context', 'audience', etc.
metaphor - using one thing to describe another thing which has similar qualities (e.g. 'Education is the key to
success.')
modals (including modal verbs) - enable speakers/writers to express different shades and degrees of meaning
about things like possibility and probability (e.g. 'I may/might/must/could go.'). They are also used to express
politeness (e.g. 'Could you open the window, please?').
mode - There are different modes of communication: the written mode, the spoken or oral mode, the visual
mode (which includes graphic forms such as charts). Changing information from one mode to another (e.g.
using a graph to write a passage, using information from an oral text to label a picture) is a very important part
of language learning.
multimedia - an integrated range of modes that could include text, visual material, sound, video, etc.
multimodal texts - texts which are designed to make use of more than one mode of communication (e.g. sound,
print and images)

personification - attributing human characteristics to non-human things (e.g. 'Mrs Sun is smiling; she's getting
out of bed.')
phoneme - the separate sounds of a language (e.g. 't', 'th', 'k', 'sh', 'ee/ea' and 'oa' are all phonemes of
English)
phonemic awareness - the ability to distinguish between the separate sounds of the language (e.g. in English
to identify the same sound in 'bad', 'sad', 'glad', 'mad', and to distinguish between the sounds in 'bed', 'bad',
'bud' and 'bird')
phonics - the relationship between sounds and their spelling. This assists in word recognition when reading and
helps one to spell.
phonic families - groups of words containing the same sound (e.g. 'bad', 'sad', 'glad', 'mad')
pun - a play on words (e.g. 'Seven days without water makes one weak.')
punch line - the last few words of a joke or story that give it meaning and make it funny
reading vocabulary - words which a reader understands in context. Some of these words will be part of the
reader's active vocabulary (words they use). Other will be part of their passive vocabulary (words they can
understand in context but do not know well enough to use).
to recount - to tell about past events in a sequence (e.g. to say or write about what one did last weekend)
a recount - a type of text. The speaker or writer describes a sequence of events. An example would be a child
telling what happened at the weekend in the class 'news time'.

Reference Lists
sarcasm - speaking or writing using expressions which clearly mean the opposite of what is felt, in order to
be unkind or offensive in an amusing way (e.g. saying to someone who has arrived at a meeting very late,
'So good of you to come.')
scaffolding - When we 'scaffold' learning, learners are enabled to do things with support that they could not
otherwise do. Once they are able to do the task independently, the temporary scaffolding can be taken away.
scanning - to run one's eyes over a text in order to find specific information (e.g. scan a telephone directory for
a name and number, or a timetable for the time of a train or bus)
simile - comparing one thing directly with another (e.g. 'Her nails were as red as blood.' 'His smile was like
sunshine.')
sight words - words that readers recognise automatically (on sight). They do not need to decode them
phonically or think about them. In the early stages of reading, sight words are usually frequently-occurring or
'high frequency' words like 'he', 'she', 'they', 'a', 'the, 'are', 'were', 'my', etc.
skimming - to read a text very quickly to get an overview (e.g. skim the newspaper headlines for the main news)
slang - informal language often used by a particular group of people (e.g. teenage slang)
standard - The standard variety of a language is that which is printed in books, newspapers, official documents,
grammars and dictionaries. It is not necessarily the best form of the language, but it is the one that has become
accepted for historical and/or political reasons as the standard variety.
stereotype - a fixed (and often biased) view about what a particular type of person (e.g. a woman, a foreigner, a
particular race) is like
stress (word, sentence) - to give force to a particular syllable in a word (e.g. the word 'machine' is stressed on
its second syllable); to give force to particular words in a sentence (e.g. 'The girl walked across to the other side
of the road.')
subordinate clause - the clause in a sentence which depends on the main clause (e.g. 'When I get there, I will
phone you.')
syllable, syllabification, polysyllabic - a word or part of a word which contains a vowel sound or a consonant
acting as a vowel (e.g. the word 'bottle' has two vowel sounds 'bott' and a syllabic 'l'). Syllabification is the
way in which syllables form together to make words. A polysyllabic word is a word with more than one syllable
(e.g. 'umbrella' has three syllables; it is polysyllabic).
symbol - something which stands for or represents something else (e.g. 'A dove is a symbol of peace.')
synonym - a word which has the same meaning or nearly the same meaning as another word in the same language
(e.g. big and large are synonyms in English)

synthesise, synthesis - to draw together and combine information or ideas from a variety of sources.
A synthesis is a clear and succinct summary of these combined ideas.
tempo (e.g. speech tempo) - the speed at which spoken words are delivered (e.g. in a speech or the performance
of a poem)

text structure - There are different kinds of texts with recognisable structures (e.g. conversations, poems, letters,
jokes, instructions, stories, novels, plays, etc.).
tone - tone is the emotional message of a text. In a written text, it is achieved through words (e.g. neutral word
to create an objective tone). In a film, it could be created through music or the setting.
understatement - a statement which is not strong enough to express the true or full facts or feelings (e.g. 'To
say I am angry is the understatement of the year.')
visual discrimination - distinguishing between the shape of different letters and words
weak vowels - in English the vowels in unstressed syllables have a weak form (e.g. the vowel sound at the
beginning of the words 'about' or 'machine' ; the vowel sounds in words like 'a', 'the' and 'at' are usually
unstressed)
word bank - a store or file of new words
xenophobia, xenophobic - xenophobia is an unreasonable fear or hatred of foreigners; xenophobic language is
language which expresses this

Page Overview
The development of a national curriculum is a major challenge for any nation.
At its broadest level, our education system and its curriculum express our idea
of ourselves as a society and our vision as to how we see the new form of society
being realised through our children and learners. Through its selection of
what is to be in the curriculum, it represents our priorities and assumptions of
what constitutes a 'good education' at its deepest level.
This curriculum is written by South Africans for South Africans who hold dear
the principles and practices of democracy. It encapsulates our vision of teachers
and learners who are knowledgeable and multi-faceted, sensitive to environmental
issues and able to respond to and act upon the many challenges that will
still confront South Africa in this twenty first century.
But we must also be realistic about what a curriculum can and cannot achieve.
Inequality and poverty still plague the educational experience of too many families
and their children. The curriculum is and will be differently interpreted and
enacted in diverse contexts. We will improve and implement it to the best of our
ability. We will also make the most strenuous efforts to enable the realisation of
its vision through addressing all those issues which make up teaching and learning.
This requires the commitment and participation of all who work in education.
We need the full cooperation of the Government, parents, teachers, learners and
the community at large. I trust this Revised National Curriculum Statement will
embody the ideals which will promote such cooperation.

Preface
Preface
At its special meeting of 12 September 1997, the Heads of Education
Departments Committee recommended the Draft Statement of the National
Curriculum for Grades R-9 for Ministerial approval. It was referred to and
approved by the Council of Education Ministers at its meeting of 29 September
1997 as three separate policy documents for the Foundation Phase, the
Intermediate Phase and the Senior Phase.
At its meeting in June 2000, the Council of Education Ministers agreed that the
Statement of the National Curriculum for Grades R-9 should be revised in
accordance with the recommendations of the Report of the Review Committee
(31 May 2000) to streamline and strengthen Curriculum 2005.
A Ministerial Project Committee to Streamline and Strengthen Curriculum 2005
was subsequently established for the task. The process of revision was begun in
January 2001 with approximately 150 curriculum developers drawn from the
educational community. On 30 July 2001, the Draft Revised National
Curriculum Statement for Grades R-9 (Schools) was released for public
comment for a period of three months. In November, public hearings were held
on the curriculum. Once the public comment and contributions at the public
hearings were received and analysed, the curriculum working groups of the
Ministerial Project Committee were reconvened in December 2001 to
incorporate suggested changes for improvement. The revised National
Curriculum Statement is the result of that process.
This document and the eight Learning Area Statements published as Addenda
constitute the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools).
The Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) will replace
the Statement of the National Curriculum for Grades R-9 approved in 1997 once
it is introduced into the system.
A comprehensive and participatory implementation strategy and plan will be
developed with all relevant social partners to ensure the successful introduction
of the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grade R-9 (Schools).
The current Assessment Policy of 23 December 1998 (Government Gazette No
19640) and the Language-in-Education Policy of 14 July 1997 (Government
Gazette No 17997) need to be read in conjunction with the Revised National
Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools). The Assessment Policy also needs

to be read alongside the relevant section of each Learning Area Statement. Until
2008, the policy currently related to certification will prevail. Thereafter the
General Education and Training Certificate aligned to this Revised National
Curriculum Statement will come into force. The General Education and
Training Certificate for compulsory schooling is a whole qualification for
schools based on the extent to which the learning outcomes are achieved
through the Grade 9 assessment standards.

Page Overview
South Africa's democratic government inherited a divided and unequal system
of education. Under apartheid, South Africa had nineteen different educational
departments separated by race, geography and ideology. This education system
prepared children in different ways for the positions they were expected to
occupy in social, economic and political life under apartheid. In each
department, the curriculum played a powerful role in reinforcing inequality.
What, how and whether children were taught differed according to the roles
they were expected to play in the wider society.
Curriculum change in post-apartheid South Africa started immediately after the
election in 1994 when the National Education and Training Forum began a
process of syllabus revision and subject rationalisation. The purpose of this
process was mainly to lay the foundations for a single national core syllabus. In
addition to the rationalisation and consolidation of existing syllabi, the National
Education and Training Forum curriculum developers removed overtly racist
and other insensitive language from existing syllabi. For the first time
curriculum decisions were made in a participatory and representative manner.
But this process was not, nor did it intend to be, a curriculum development
process.
The Lifelong Learning through a National Curriculum Framework document (1996)
was the first major curriculum statement of a democratic South Africa. It was
informed by principles derived from the White Paper on Education and Training
(1995), the South African Qualifications Act (No 58 of 1995) and the National
Education Policy Act (No 27 of 1996). In terms of the White Paper, it emphasised
the need for major changes in education and training in South Africa in order to
normalise and transform teaching and learning in South Africa. It also stressed
the need for a shift from the traditional aims-and-objectives approach to outcomes-
based education. It promoted a vision of:
Aprosperous, truly united, democratic and internationally competitive country
with literate, creative and critical citizens leading productive, self-fulfilled
lives in a country free of violence, discrimination and prejudice.
The National Education Policy Act (No 27 of 1996) provided for the
development of the following curriculum design tools to support an outcomesbased
approach:
??Critical Cross-Field Outcomes (later to be known as the critical and
developmental outcomes, and first formulated in the South African
Qualifications Authority Act of 1995)
Background
Background
??Specific Outcomes
??Range Statements
?Assessment Criteria
??Performance Indicators
??Notional Time and Flexi-Time
??Continuous Assessment, Recording and Reporting
Additional curriculum design tools were formulated in succeeding years and
included:
??Phase Organisers
??Programme Organisers
??Expected Levels of Performance
??Learning Programmes
In October 1997, the Statement of the National Curriculum for Grades R-9 was
published in terms of Government Notice 1445. The Assessment Policy in the
General Education and Training band for Grades R-9 and Adult Basic Education
and Training, was introduced in December 1998 (Regulation 19640). Introduced
into schools in 1998, Curriculum 2005 and its implementation were reviewed by
a Ministerial Committee in 2000. The brief of the review was the structure and
design of the curriculum, teacher orientation, training and development,
learning support materials, provincial support to teachers in schools and
implementation time-frames. The Ministerial Review Committee presented its
report on 31 May 2000.
The Review Committee recommended that strengthening the curriculum
required streamlining its design features and simplifying its language through
the production of an amended National Curriculum Statement. It further
recommended that this Revised National Curriculum Statement should reduce
the curriculum design features from eight to three: critical and developmental
outcomes, learning outcomes and assessment standards. It should also align
curriculum and assessment. In addition, it recommended that implementation
needed to be strengthened by improving teacher orientation and training,
learning support materials and provincial support. It also recommended the
relaxation of time-frames for implementation.
In June 2000, the Council of Education Ministers accepted the curriculum
recommendations of the Review Committee. In July 2000, Cabinet resolved that:
5
Page Overview
The development of a National Curriculum Statement, which must deal in
clear and simple language with what the curriculum requirements are at
various levels and phases, must begin immediately. Such a Statement must
also address the concerns around curriculum overload and must give a
clear description of the kind of learner in terms of knowledge, skills, values
and attitudes - that is expected at the end of the General Education and
Training band.
The revision of Curriculum 2005 resulted in a Draft Revised National
Curriculum Statement for Grades R-9 (Schools). This Draft Revised National
Curriculum Statement for Grades R-9 (Schools) was made available for public
comment on 30 July 2001. It was subsequently revised in the light of public
comment during 2001/2002. The revised National Curriculum Statement is thus
not a new curriculum but a streamlining and strengthening of Curriculum 2005.
It keeps intact the principles, purposes and thrust of Curriculum 2005 and
affirms the commitment to outcomes-based education.
As this curriculum revision process has proceeded, the practice in schools from
Grade R-9 has continued in terms of previous policy. When the Revised
National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) becomes policy, it will
replace the Statement of the National Curriculum for Grades R-9 approved in
1997. Introduction of the Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9
(Schools) in the Foundation Phase is planned for 2004.
This document introduces and provides background to the eight Learning Area
Statements that form the foundation of the Revised National Curriculum
Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) in the General Education and Training band.
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act No 108 of 1996)
provides the basis for curriculum transformation and development in
contemporary South Africa. The preamble to the Constitution states that the
aims of the Constitution are to:
6
Page Overview
The Constitution, Values, Nation-building
and the Curriculum
The Constitution, Values, Nationbuilding
and the Curriculum
??Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic
values, social justice and fundamental human rights.
??Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each
person.
??Lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which
Government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally
protected by law.
??Build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place
as a sovereign state in the family of nations.
The Manifesto on Values, Education and Democracy (Department of Education,
2001) identifies ten fundamental values of the Constitution. These are:
??Democracy
??Social Justice and Equity
??Non-Racism and Non-Sexism
??Ubuntu (Human Dignity)
?An Open Society
?Accountability (Responsibility)
??Respect
??The Rule of Law
??Reconciliation
The Manifesto further identifies 16 strategies for familiarising young South
Africans with the values of the Constitution. These strategies find expression in
the Revised National Curriculum Statement and include:
??Nurturing a culture of communication and participation in school.
??Role-modelling: promoting commitment as well as competence amongst
educators.
??Ensuring that every South African is able to read, write, count and think.
??Infusing the classroom with a culture of human rights.
??Making Arts and Culture part of the curriculum.
??Putting history back into the curriculum.
??Learning about the rich diversity of cultures, beliefs and world views within
which the unity of South Africa is manifested.
??Making multilingualism happen.
??Using sport to shape social bonds and nurture nation-building at schools.
??Ensuring equal access to education.
??Promoting anti-racism in schools.
7

??Freeing the potential of girls as well as boys.
??Dealing with HIV/AIDS and nurturing a culture of sexual and social
responsibility.
??Making schools safe to learn and teach in and ensuring the rule of law.
??Promoting ethics and the environment.
??Nurturing the new patriotism, or affirming a common citizenship.
The Constitution expresses the nation's social values and its expectations of the
roles, rights and responsibilities of citizens in a democratic South Africa. The Bill
of Rights places pre-eminent value on equality, human dignity, life, and freedom
and security of persons. These and other rights to freedom of religion and belief,
expression and association, exist side-by-side with socio-economic rights. Each
person has a right to freedom from poverty, homelessness, poor health and
hunger.
The Revised National Curriculum Statement seeks to embody these values in
the knowledge and skills it develops. It encourages amongst all learners an
awareness and understanding of the rich diversity of cultures, beliefs and world
views within which the unity of South Africa is manifested.
The challenge for the Revised National Curriculum Statement is how the goals
and values of social justice, equity and democracy can be interwoven across the
curriculum. The promotion of values is important not only for the sake of personal
development, but also to ensure that a national South African identity is
built on values different from those that underpinned apartheid education. The
kind of learner envisaged is one who will be imbued with the values and act in
the interests of a society based on respect for democracy, equality, human dignity,
life and social justice.
The curriculum aims to develop the full potential of each learner as a citizen of
a democratic South Africa. It seeks to create a lifelong learner who is confident
and independent, literate, numerate and multi-skilled, compassionate, with a
respect for the environment and the ability to participate in society as a critical
and active citizen.

The Kind of Learner that is Envisaged
Educators at all levels are key contributors to the transformation of education in
South Africa. Teachers have a particularly important role to play. The National
Curriculum Statement envisions teachers who are qualified, competent, dedicated
and caring and who will be able to fulfil the various roles outlined in the
Norms and Standards for Educators of 2000 (Government Gazette No 20844).
These see teachers as mediators of learning, interpreters and designers of
Learning Programmes and materials, leaders, administrators and managers,
scholars, researchers and lifelong learners, community members, citizens and
pastors, assessors and learning area/phase specialists.
The Revised National Curriculum Statement consists of this overview document
and eight Learning Area Statements.
There are eight Learning Areas in the National Curriculum Statement. A
Learning Area is a field of knowledge, skills and values which has unique
features as well as connections with other fields of knowledge and Learning
Areas. In this Revised National Curriculum Statement, the Learning Areas are:
??Languages
??Mathematics
??Natural Sciences
??Technology
??Social Sciences
?Arts and Culture
??Life Orientation
??Economic and Management Sciences

(Schools)
Structure of the Revised
National Curriculum Statement
Grades R-9 (Schools)
The relationship between human rights, a healthy environment and social
justice is addressed in each Learning Area Statement.
The Learning Area Statements provide a guideline of requirements and expectations
from Grade R to 9 for schools in the General Education and Training
band.
The Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) builds on the
vision and values of the Constitution and Curriculum 2005. These principles
include:
Social Justice, a Healthy Environment, Human Rights and
Inclusivity
The curriculum can play a vital role in creating awareness of the relationship
between human rights, a healthy environment, social justice and inclusivity. In
some countries this is done through subjects such as civics. The Revised
National Curriculum Statement has tried to ensure that all Learning Area
Statements reflect the principles and practices of social justice, respect for the
environment and human rights as defined in the Constitution. In particular, the
curriculum attempts to be sensitive to issues of poverty, inequality, race, gender,
age, disability, and such challenges as HIV/AIDS.
The Revised National Curriculum Statement adopts an inclusive approach by
specifying minimum requirements for all learners. The special educational,
social, emotional and physical needs of learners will be addressed in the design
and development of appropriate Learning Programmes.
Outcomes-based Education
Outcomes-based education considers the process of learning as important as the
content. Both the process and the content of education are emphasised by
10

Curriculum Statement

Outcomes-based Education
spelling out the outcomes to be achieved at the end of the process. In the Revised
National Curriculum Statement learning outcomes and assessment standards
were designed down from the critical and developmental outcomes.
The critical and developmental outcomes are a list of outcomes that are derived
from the Constitution and are contained in the South African Qualifications Act
(1995). They describe the kind of citizen the education and training system
should aim to create. The critical outcomes envisage learners who will be able
to:
??Identify and solve problems and make decisions using critical and creative
thinking.
??Work effectively with others as members of a team, group, organisation
and community.
??Organise and manage themselves and their activities responsibly and
effectively.
??Collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information.
??Communicate effectively using visual, symbolic and/or language skills in
various modes.
??Use Science and Technology effectively and critically showing
responsibility towards the environment and the health of others.
??Demonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by
recognising that problem-solving contexts do not exist in isolation.
The developmental outcomes envisage learners who are also able to:
??Reflect on and explore a variety of strategies to learn more effectively.
??Participate as responsible citizens in the life of local, national, and global
communities.
??Be culturally and aesthetically sensitive across a range of social contexts.
??Explore education and career opportunities.
??Develop entrepreneurial opportunities.
The Revised National Curriculum Statement attempts to embody and uphold a
democratic vision of the society and the citizens that should emerge from our
school system.
By means of the Learning Area Statements, the Revised National Curriculum
Statement identifies the goals, expectations and outcomes to be achieved
11
Page Overview
through related learning outcomes and assessment standards. The learning
outcomes for each Learning Area are provided later in this document. The
assessment standards are in the actual Learning Area Statements that are
published as Addenda to the document.
The outcomes and assessment standards emphasise participatory, learnercentred
and activity-based education. They leave considerable room for creativity
and innovation on the part of teachers in interpreting what and how to teach.
The South African version of outcomes-based education is aimed at stimulating
the minds of young people so that they are able to participate fully in economic
and social life. It is intended to ensure that all learners are able to develop and
achieve to their maximum ability and are equipped for lifelong learning.
A High Level of Skills and Knowledge for All
The Revised National Curriculum Statement aims at the development of a high
level of knowledge and skills for all. It sets and holds up high expectations of
what South African learners can achieve. Social justice requires that those
sections of the population previously disempowered by the lack of knowledge
and skills should now be empowered. The Revised National Curriculum
Statement aims to provide for a stronger base from which to enable the
development of a high level of skills and knowledge by all. It does so by specifying
the combination of minimum knowledge and skills to be achieved by
learners in each grade and setting high, achievable standards in all the Learning
Areas.
Clarity and Accessibility
The Revised National Curriculum Statement aims at clarity and accessibility
both in its design and language. Two design features - learning outcomes and
assessment standards - clearly define for all learners the goals and outcomes
necessary to proceed to each successive level of the system. In addition, the
Revised National Curriculum Statement will be available in all official
languages and braille.
12

Clarity and Accessibility
Progression and Integration
The principle of integrated learning is integral to outcomes-based education.
Integration ensures that learners experience the Learning Areas as linked and
related. It supports and expands their opportunities to attain skills, acquire
knowledge and develop attitudes and values encompassed across the
curriculum.
It is important that the curriculum sets out progressively more complex, deeper
and broader expectations of learners. Conceptual progression is a term used to
describe this feature of a curriculum. In the Revised National Curriculum
Statement, the assessment standards in each Learning Area Statement provide
the conceptual progression in each Learning Area from grade to grade.
At the same time, learners should not deal with assessment standards in
isolation. Links must be made within and across learning outcomes and
Learning Areas. The achievement of an optimal relationship between integration
across learning areas and conceptual progression from grade to grade are central
to this curriculum.
The ongoing development of teachers, school management teams and
departmental support personnel is an important facet of this goal.
Each Learning Area Statement consists of three sections:
An introduction: This section introduces the National Curriculum Statement
and the particular Learning Area - its goals and unique features.
A section on learning outcomes and assessment standards: These express the
requirements and expectations of learners by grade at the Foundation (Grades
R-3), Intermediate (Grades 4-6) and Senior (Grades 7-9) Phases. The Foundation
Phase focuses on the primary skills, knowledge and values to ensure the
development of further learning. The learning outcomes and assessment

standards should be seen as minimum or essential knowledge, values and skills
to be covered but should not be all that is taught. They indicate what is essential
for progression through the system and are designed in relation to the Grade 9
requirements.
A section on assessment: This section outlines principles and guidelines for
assessment and makes suggestions for recording and reporting assessment.
Reference lists: This section usually includes abbreviations, acronyms and a
glossary.
What is a Learning Outcome?
A learning outcome is derived from the critical and developmental outcomes. It
is a description of what (knowledge, skills and values) learners should know,
demonstrate and be able to do at the end of the General Education and Training
band. A set of learning outcomes should ensure integration and progression in
the development of concepts, skills and values through the assessment
standards. Learning outcomes do not prescribe content or method.
What is an Assessment Standard?
Assessment standards describe the level at which learners should demonstrate
their achievement of the learning outcome(s) and the ways (depth and breadth)
of demonstrating their achievement. They are grade specific and show how
conceptual progression will occur in a Learning Area. They embody the
knowledge, skills and values required to achieve learning outcomes. They do
not prescribe method.
How different is an Assessment Standard from a Learning
Outcome?
The learning outcomes describe what learners should know and be able to do.
Assessment standards describe the minimum level, depth and breadth of what
is to be learnt. In practical terms this means that learning outcomes can and will,
in most cases, remain the same from grade to grade while assessment standards
change from grade to grade.
The assessment standards also contribute towards the qualification. In the case
of the General Education and Training band, this means the General Education

and Training Certificate.
Learning support materials and teacher development programmes will play an
important role in interpreting and giving expression to the learning outcomes
and assessment standards.
The Revised National Curriculum Statement Grades R-9 (Schools) will be
implemented in schools by means of Learning Programmes. Learning
Programmes are structured and systematic arrangements of activities that
promote the attainment of learning outcomes and assessment standards for the
phase.
Whereas the Revised National Curriculum Statement stipulates the concepts,
skills and values on a grade-by-grade basis, Learning Programmes specify the
scope of learning and assessment activities per phase. Learning Programmes
also contain work schedules that provide the pace and the sequencing of these
activities each year as well as exemplars of lesson plans to be implemented in
any given period. The underlying principles and values of the Revised National
Curriculum Statement also underpin the Learning Programmes.
Learning Programmes must ensure that all learning outcomes and assessment
standards are effectively pursued and that each learning area is allocated its
prescribed time and emphasis. Learning Programmes will be based on
relationships amongst learning outcomes and assessment standards, without
compromising the integrity of Learning Areas.
Learning Programmes Per Phase
In the Foundation Phase, there are three Learning Programmes: Literacy,
Numeracy and Life Skills.
In the Intermediate Phase, Languages and Mathematics are distinct Learning
Programmes. Learning Programmes must ensure that the prescribed outcomes
for each learning area are covered effectively and comprehensively. Schools
maydecide on the number and nature of other Learning Programmes based on
the organisational imperatives of the school, provided that the national priori-
15
Page Overview

ties and developmental needs of learners in a phase are taken into account.
In the Senior Phase, there are eight Learning Programmes based on the Learning
Area Statements.
Teachers will be responsible for the development of Learning Programmes. The
Department of Education will provide policy guidelines for the development of
Learning Programmes in order to support this process. Provinces will develop
further guidelines where necessary in order to accommodate diversity.
Teacher education programmes will build the capacity of teachers, school
management teams and departmental support personnel to develop,
implement, manage and support the development of Learning Programmes.
Learning Programme Guidelines
To ensure achievement of national standards set by the Revised National
Curriculum Statement, policy guidelines for relevant and appropriate Learning
Programmes will be developed at national level in collaboration with provinces.
These guidelines will emphasise the principle of integrated learning and the
achievement of an optimal relationship between integration across learning
areas and conceptual progression from grade to grade. The National Education
Policy Act (1996, section 3, paragraph 4) empowers the Minister of Education to
determine, among other things, such a national policy guideline for the development
of Learning Programmes.
These policy guidelines will provide information and guidance on:
??Integration within and across learning areas
??Clustering of assessment standards
??Relationships between learning outcomes
??Time allocation
?Assessment
??Barriers to learning
??Designing a Learning Programme
??Policy and legislation
??Training, development and delivery
??Resourcing and support
??Planning and organisation
These guidelines will be applied within the context of existing policy and
16
Page Overview
Learning Programme Guidelines
legislative frameworks such as the six White Papers on Education, the National
Education Policy Act (1996), the South African Schools Act (1996) and the
Employment of Educators Act (1998). Learning Programme guidelines will offer
a framework to address specific learner and contextual needs.
Time Allocations
In terms of Section 4 of the Employment of Educators Act, (1998), the formal
school day for teachers will be seven hours. In terms of the National Education
Policy Act, (1996), the formal teaching time per school week is 35 hours. This is
set out in the following table:

an outcomes-based framework the most suitable assessment methods that
accommodate divergent contextual factors are used. Assessment should
provide indications of learner achievement in the most effective and efficient
manner, and ensure that learners integrate and apply knowledge and skills.
Assessment should also help students to make judgments about their own
performance, set goals for progress and provoke further learning.

The Revised National Curriculum Statement aligns the curriculum with assessment
policy contained in the Assessment Policy (Government Gazette No 19640
of 1998). A common guideline for teachers is contained at the end of each
Learning Area Statement.
All teaching and learning from Grade R to 9 contributes to the type of learner
envisaged by the National Curriculum Statement. Assessment of this learning
takes place on a continuous basis throughout the ten years of school. The
assessment and certification of this cumulative learning take place at the end of
Grade 9 when learners who meet the specified requirements will be awarded a
General Education and Training Certificate.
The General Education and Training Certificate for compulsory schooling is a
whole qualification for schools based on the extent to which the learning
outcomes are achieved through the Grade 9 assessment standards.
Until 2008, the policy currently related to certification will prevail. Thereafter the
General Education and Training Certificate aligned to this Revised National
Curriculum Statement will come into force.
Languages

The Languages Learning Area Statement includes:
?All eleven official languages: Sepedi, Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati,
Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, English, isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu.

(PANSALB) and the South African Certification Authority (SAFCERT) such
as braille and South African Sign Language.
In a multilingual country like South Africa it is important that learners reach
high levels of proficiency in at least two languages, and that they are able to
communicate in other languages.
The Languages Learning Area Statement follows an additive or incremental
approach to multilingualism:
?All learners learn their home language and at least one additional official
language.
??Learners become competent in their additional language, while their home
language is maintained and developed.
The Languages Learning Area Statement covers all official languages as:
??Home languages
??First additional languages
??Second additional languages
Learners' home languages should be used for learning and teaching whenever
possible. This is particularly important in the Foundation Phase where children
learn to read and write. When learners have to make a transition from their
home language to an additional language for learning and teaching, careful
planning is necessary.
Outcomes
1. Listening: The learner is able to listen for information and enjoyment, and
respond appropriately and critically in a wide range of situations.
2. Speaking: The learner is able to communicate confidently and effectively
in a spoken language in a wide range of situations.
3. Reading and Viewing: The learner is able to read and view for information
and enjoyment, and respond critically to the aesthetic, cultural and emotional
values in texts.
4. Writing: The learner is able to write different kinds of factual and imaginative
texts for a wide range of purposes.
20
Page Overview
Outcomes
5. Thinking and Reasoning: The learner is able to use language to think and
reason, and access, process and use information for learning.
6. Language Structure and Use: The learner knows and is able to use the
sounds, words and the grammar of a language to create and interpret texts.
Listening and speaking; reading and viewing; writing; thinking and reasoning;
and the knowledge of sounds, words and grammar, although presented as
separate outcomes, should be integrated in teaching and assessment.
Mathematics
Definition
Mathematics is a human activity that involves observing, representing and
investigating patterns and quantitative relationships in physical and social
phenomena and between mathematical objects themselves. Through this
process new mathematical ideas and insights are generated.
Mathematics uses its own specialised language that involves symbols and notations
for describing numerical, geometric and graphical relations. Mathematical
concepts build on one another, thereby creating a coherent structure.
Mathematics is a product of investigation by different cultures; it is a purposeful
activity in the context of social, political and economic goals and constraints.
It is not value-free or culturally-neutral.
Outcomes
1. Numbers, Operations and Relationships: The learner is able to recognise,
describe and represent numbers and their relationships and can count, estimate,
calculate and check with competence and confidence in solving problems.
2. Patterns, Functions and Algebra: The learner is able to recognise, describe
and represent patterns and relationships, and solves problems using
algebraic language and skills.
3. Space and Shape: The learner is able to describe and represent characteristics
and relationships between 2-D shapes and 3-D objects in a variety of
orientations and positions.
21

Definition
Outcomes
4.Measurement: The learner is able to use appropriate measuring units, instruments
and formulae in a variety of contexts.
5.Data Handling: The learner is able to collect, summarise, display and critically
analyse data in order to draw conclusions and make predictions, and to
interpret and determine chance variation.
Natural Sciences
Definition
What is today known as 'Science' has its roots in African, Arabic, Asian,
American and European cultures. It has been shaped by the search to understand
the natural world through observation, codifying and testing ideas, and
has evolved to become part of the cultural heritage of all nations. It is usually
'characterised by the possibility of making precise statements which are susceptible
of some sort of check or proof' (McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopaedia of
Science and Technology, 2nd Edition, p. 1647).
The Natural Sciences Learning Area Statement envisages a teaching and learning
milieu that recognises that the people of South Africa have a variety of learning
styles as well as culturally influenced perspectives. The Natural Sciences
Learning Area starts from the premise that all learners should have access to a
meaningful science education. Meaningful education has to be learner-centred.
It has to help learners to understand not only scientific knowledge and how it is
produced but also the environmental and global issues. The Natural Sciences
Learning Area aims to provide a foundation on which learners can build
throughout life.
The Natural Sciences Learning Area Statement promotes scientific literacy. It
does this by focusing on:
??The development and use of science process skills in a variety of settings.
??The development and application of scientific knowledge and
understanding.
?Appreciation of the relationships and responsibilities between Science,
society and the environment.
22

Outcomes
1. Scientific Investigations: Learners act confidently on their curiosity about
natural phenomena; they investigate relationships and solve problems in
Science, Technology and environmental contexts.
2. Constructing Science Knowledge: Learners know, interpret and apply scientific,
technological and environmental knowledge.
3. Science, Society and the Environment: Learners are able to demonstrate
an understanding of the interrelationships between Science and
Technology, society and the environment.
Social Sciences
Definition
The Social Sciences study relationships between people, and between people
and the environment. These relationships vary over time and space. They are
also influenced by social, political, economic and environmental contexts, and
by people's values, attitudes and beliefs.
The concepts, skills and processes of History and Geography form key elements
of the Social Sciences Learning Area Statement. Environmental education and
human rights education are integral to both History and Geography.
The Social Sciences Learning Area Statement is concerned with what learners
learn and how learners learn, and how learners construct knowledge. The
Learning Area Statement encourages learners to ask and find answers to questions
about society and the environment in which they live.
This Learning Area Statement aims at contributing to the development of
informed, critical and responsible citizens who are able to participate constructively
in a culturally diverse and changing society. It also equips learners to contribute
to the development of a just and democratic society.

CALL TO ACTION: MOBILISING CITIZENS TO BUILD A SOUTH AFRICAN EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM FOR THE 21st CENTURY
By Professor Kader Asmal, MP, Minister of Education, 
Tuesday 27 July 1999
 
A MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT THABO MBEKI
"Education and training must constitute the decisive drivers in our efforts to build a winning nation.
"The Government will therefore intensify its focus on education so we succeed in producing an educated and skilled population.
"A great deal of work has already been done, but we will ensure that existing policies and programmes are carried out with a sense of urgency and commitment to their success.
"To achieve these results, we will also have to engage in massive in-service and pre-service training. All necessary steps must and will be taken to ensure that learners learn, educators educate and managers manage.
"We will also take measures to mobilise the people, including parents, so we succeed as a country to meet the challenge of educating all our people"
An exerpt from President Thabo Mbeki's first speech made as President in Parliament on 25 June 1999.
South Africa's new President recomitted Government to building a caring society that will guarantee 
the dignity of every citizen.
TIRISANO: WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD A SOUTH AFRICAN EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.
FOREWORD
A sense of urgency runs through Minister Kader Asmal's "Call to Action".
After close study of the condition of education and training, and an intense engagement with the leadership of the system in all its complexity, he has assessed the state of affairs and isolated nine areas for priority attention.
Three themes predominate in this statement: 
* The vital value of a fully-functioning education and training system to the health and prosperity of the nation. 
* The urgent need to remedy the injustice and assault on human dignity embodied in our inheritance of educational deprivation. 
* The conviction that South Africans can mobilise untapped reserves of resourcefulness and determination to extend education opportunity and restore education to the centre of community life. 
The nine-point priority programme in the "Call to Action" speech is selective by definition. It does not attempt to cover every aspect of the system. While drawing attention to nine broad areas of major importance, the Ministry of Education is committed to education reconstruction and development in all phases of the system and at every level, from early childhood development to postgraduate education and research. The Ministry will continue to work with all partners in education to strengthen our education foundations and help raise a permanent edifice of lifelong learning of which our nation can be proud.
Trevor Coombe
Acting Director-General, Department of Education
INTRODUCTION
Today I am announcing the start of a national mobilisation for education and training.
At the first Cabinet meeting of the new government, President Thabo Mbeki posed the question: "Is our education system on the road to the 21st century?" 
The South African public has a vital interest in the answer.
Today, having consulted virtually the entire leadership corps of the education and training system, I can give him and the nation my reply.
EXPLORING THE TERRAIN
For the past five weeks, I have undertaken a wonderful mission of discovery. I have read dozens of documents. My officials have given me copious briefings. In a week of meetings unprecedented in their intensity and frankness, I have met the leading representatives of every significant national education structure. 
They spoke for statutory bodies in education and training, commissions established by our constitution for the protection of democracy, the representative associations of vice-chancellors and principals at all levels, national governing body associations, all national teachers' unions and staff associations, national student bodies representing all levels, leaders in adult education, early childhood development, and education for special needs, organised labour and business. 
We talked, we disputed, and we found common ground. Finally, to cap this extraordinary listening campaign, I consulted yesterday with my provincial colleagues in the Council of Education Ministers.
I want to select three salient points from the hundreds of facts, ideas and impressions that the listening campaign has evoked. 
We have strong, committed leadership for the 21st century
Firstly, the leadership of our education and training system in the field embodies remarkable qualities of patriotism, talent, experience, and commitment. The leaders I have met, and the organisations and institutions they represent, have been making heroic unsung contributions to the transformation of our education and training system. I salute them. They are an essential resource for the next phase of our education revolution. What is more, they want to get on with it.
We have excellent policies and laws for the 21st century
Secondly, I was told by everyone I met that we have created a set of policies and laws in education and training that are at least equal to the best in the world. 
In 1994, as we turned our back for good on the divisive and cruel legacy of apartheid, education was considered the most explosive and contentious area of national life. I am proud that our young democratic government, after inclusive and genuine consultation, has built a national consensus around the main education policy positions of the mass democratic movement, while simultaneously re-organising the entire structure of education administration and provision. 
The important thing about building consensus for a policy or a law is that people own it and want to make it work. Implementation takes time, but I have seen convincing evidence that it is happening in all parts of the system, for instance in adult basic education and training, early childhood learning, school curriculum, further education and training, higher education planning, democratic governance, and quality management.
There has been a revolutionary change in South African thinking about education and training. The consensus we have achieved is based squarely on our democratic Constitution, deals squarely with South African realities, and aligns us to respond to the global challenges of the new century.
In crucial respects we are not ready for the 21st century 
Thirdly, the national education leadership is unanimous that our system of education and training has major weaknesses and carries deadly baggage from our past. Large parts of our system are seriously dysfunctional. It will not be an exaggeration to say that there is a crisis at each level of the system.
I will select the worst and most troubling features of our education and training system for special mention: the massive inequalities in access and facilities, the serious state of morale of the teaching force, failures in governance and management, and the poor quality of learning in much of the system.
WHERE WE ARE FAILING
 
Rampant inequality
Firstly, there is rampant inequality of access to educational opportunities of satisfactory standard. In particular, poor people in all communities, of whom the overwhelming majority are rural Africans, continue to attend decrepit schools, too often without water or sanitation, electricity or telephone, library, workshop or laboratory. Their teachers may never see their supervisors from one year to the next. Their parents remain illiterate, poor and powerless. They are unable to give practical and intellectual support to the educational aspirations of their children. 
For such children of democratic South Africa, the promises of the Bill of Rights remain a distant dream. Without a solid foundation of learning, their chances of educational and economic success in later years are dim. So poverty reproduces itself.
Low teacher morale
Secondly, I was told repeatedly that the morale of teachers in all communities is low. This is more complex terrain, because the causes and the incidence may be different in different institutions. 
It is obvious that many teachers have been demoralised by the uncertainty and distress of rationalisation and redeployment. Since 1995, protracted consultation, bargaining, legal and labour action, and a lot of sensational rumour mongering have accompanied this process. The cause of equitable and sustainable provision of teachers is just and necessary, but the cost has been high. Teachers have a reasonable expectation of stability and job security, but that has been long in coming.
Another potent reason is the vulnerability of learners and teachers in many schools, colleges and other educational institutions to crimes of trespass, vandalism, carrying and using weapons, drug-dealing, rape, sexual abuse and other forms of physical assault or even murder. Whether committed inside or outside the gates, such outrages create insecurity and fear, and destroy the basis of a learning community.
Indiscipline on the part of principals, teachers and learners was also cited repeatedly as a source of demoralisation among those who want to work and succeed. I was particularly appalled by the repeated observations that too many schools fail to start on time and close early, that too many learners absent themselves at will, that too many teachers believe that their obligations cease at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock on a school day.
Many educators at all levels may suffer a more subtle and insidious form of demoralisation if they are not professionally equipped or resourced to cope with the new demands that are being made of them, whether arising from racial integration, or new curricula and pedagogy. 
Failures of governance and management
The third disturbing feature to which my attention has been drawn is the serious crisis of leadership, governance, management and administration in many parts of the system. This has many facets. The most serious, in terms of scale, is the incapacity of several provincial departments of education to set the agenda for their systems, perform their tasks in a business-like way, and give adequate professional support to their institutions of learning. 
Within institutions, from universities and technikons to small rural schools, such failures have a drastic effect. They open wide the gate to corruption, fraud and indiscipline. They sap the morale of conscientious staff. In the end, they undermine good teaching and learning, which depend on peace, order, stability and professional challenge. 
The situation is worsened if governing authorities are ineffective, if they collude with management at the expense of other parties, or if they allow themselves to be subverted by factionalism. In such circumstances, they are unable to fulfil their essential role of good governance and true stewardship of the interests of the institutions they have been appointed to serve. The consequences may be very costly, especially in higher education institutions.
Poor quality of learning
Given the conditions described above, it should not be surprising that the leaders of education with whom I have consulted are intensely concerned about the poor quality of learning in large parts of our system. 
The Senior Certificate examination at the end of Grade 12 is the first external check on performance in our school system, and the poor results, especially in six provinces, have shocked the nation. By comparison with other middle-income countries, our learners perform very badly in internationally standardised tests of mathematics and science. School leavers become job-seekers or enter higher education with serious gaps in fundamental knowledge, reasoning skills, and methods of study.
Overwhelmingly, poor learning is associated with poverty, bad or absent facilities, under-prepared teachers, lack of learning resources, and a serious lack of purpose and discipline in many schools, or what is called a culture of learning, teaching and service.
The number of young people who study mathematics with any degree of understanding and proficiency has declined when it should have been increasingly rapidly. As a result, mathematical illiteracy is rife in our society, and the pool of recruits for further and higher education in the information and science-based professions is shrinking, a fact that has grave implications for our national future in the 21st century.
NO TIME TO LOSE
What do I conclude from this rough balance sheet of the assets and liabilities of the education and training system? Despite our success stories, we are failing, especially in those wide-flung tracts of the system that serve poor urban and rural communities. Our new systems of governance, administration and finance have not yet succeeded in hauling these communities out of the arbitrary and unequal education conditions imposed by generations of apartheid and minority rule. In some respects and some areas, the situation has deteriorated. 
All modern nations with strong democratic traditions and successful economies have invested heavily in the education and training of their people, in order to ensure access by all citizens to educational opportunity, and continuously raise the level and quality of learning throughout their societies. Our country has a long way to go, and no time to lose. 
 
A NATIONAL MOBILISATION FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Our mandate and duty
The Constitution places a compelling duty on the government to respect, protect, promote and fulfil everyone's right to a basic education, including adult basic education, and to take reasonable measures to make further education progressively available and accessible (section 29).
In June of this year, the people of this country gave the national and provincial governments both a mandate and a responsibility to accelerate the delivery of basic services that will improve their quality of life. The public believes that we have a crisis on our hands. Our people have rights to education that the state is not upholding. They have put their confidence in the democratic process, and returned their government with an overwhelming mandate. After five years of democratic reconstruction and development, the people are entitled to a better education service and they must have it. 
We will not fulfil our democratic responsibility, nor will our nation be prepared for the demands of the 21st century, unless we rapidly improve the access of all our people to sound basic education and training in satisfactory facilities, and ensure a fully functioning system of good quality at all levels, from early childhood to university and beyond.
President Mbeki's charge
The President expects that the essential functions of the education system will be carried out efficiently and speedily. As he remarked in his reply to the debate on his State of the Nation address to Parliament, "Teachers must teach. Learners must learn. Managers must manage." That is a fundamentally reasonable expectation, on which all other education success will depend. We will attend to it.
Tirisano
I have concluded, after intensive consultation with representatives of all the main actors in education and training, and the MECs for Education, that the educational condition of the majority of people in this country amounts to a national emergency. 
A national emergency requires an exceptional response from the national and provincial governments.
I announce a national mobilisation for education and training, under the slogan "Tirisano", working together. President Mbeki announced the theme of the second democratic government, "A nation at work for a better life for all". That is what we must do in education, together. 
The details will be worked out over the coming weeks and months, in consultation with all concerned. 
The scope is vast, and even an energetic government cannot attempt everything at once. We will determine priorities, and within those priorities we will set targets. 
We will also work with other state departments on the integrated, targeted projects for rural and urban regeneration that President Mbeki called for in his speech, and that are now being planned.
What I am asking for at present is a commitment by citizens and all organs of society to work together with the Ministry of Education and the provincial education authorities to attack the most urgent problems.
National Education Parliament
Once a year, we will summon a National Education Parliament. This will be a true deliberative body of all education stakeholders. Its task will be to reflect on the state of education and training, take stock of our collective progress in attacking the priority areas of need, build solidarity among the main actors in education delivery and the education departments, and point the way forward.
NINE PRIORITIES
Priority 1: We must make our provincial systems work by making co-operative government work
The overall responsibility for the effective management of the education system rests with the Minister of Education, and I intend to fulfil that responsibility. I will do so within the letter and spirit of the Constitution, in particular the provisions relating to co-operative government, the executive authority of the Republic, and the executive authority of provinces.
Under our present arrangements, all education below the higher education level is managed by provincial governments, over which the Minister of Education has only political but not executive authority. I intend to exercise my political authority as Minister of Education as vigorously as is necessary to promote the advancement of the national education and training system. 
The management of education systems is a highly complex function of government, and provincial education departments vary considerably in their ability to manage education efficiently. The most serious problems of executive capacity are experienced in the provinces that incorporated former homelands or "independent states". The three largest provinces have the gravest difficulties. They are also the poorest provinces, with the largest backlogs of school buildings and services, and poor communications infrastructure in rural areas.
National education legislation binds provincial governments under certain conditions, and it is important, therefore, to ensure that national Acts, regulations and policies do not impose unreasonable burdens on provincial administrations. Alternatively, provincial departments must be empowered, with the assistance of the national department, to fulfil their statutory responsibilities. National laws and other instruments will be reviewed with this in mind. 
There are acute problems with the allocation and management of many provincial education budgets. The Minister of Education has some leverage on these matters through the budget process under the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, although this is largely indirect. I intend to take responsibility, with the Minister of Finance, for collaborative work on provincial education budgets, together with provincial MECs, and MECs for Economic Affairs and Finance. 
It is vital to improve the ratio of non-personnel to personnel funding. The good work being undertaken to cut waste and fraud and improve efficiency in provincial systems has my emphatic support. However, it is imperative that provincial governments allocate sufficient funds for the essential personnel and non-personnel needs of provincial education systems, and that such allocations are not tampered with during the course of the financial year.
The national Department of Education, using its ordinary budget, dedicated state grants, and external support, assists its provincial counterparts through direct administrative and professional support. I will review what is currently happening under the technical assistance programmes, in order to ensure that they are well targetted and effective, and to explore whether they could be expanded.
The Minister of Education has powers, under the National Education Policy Act, 1996, to monitor the performance of provincial education authorities in meeting their constitutional obligations and in implementing national policy. The Minister must report breaches to Parliament, as well as remedial action that is jointly planned by the provincial and national education departments. This formal power to monitor and report will be used whenever appropriate, especially when there appears to have been serious failure by provinces to meet their obligations. 
However, I will employ a faster and less formal method of monitoring and advice, by requiring all senior officials of the Department of Education and my own advisers to spend a certain amount of their time on visits to provincial education departments and institutions. Such visits, on which each officer concerned must report, will also serve as a means to cross-check whether or not national law or policy needs to be reviewed or changed.
In addition, I will report to the President every three months on the progress in provincial education, according to a set of indicators that will be discussed with the Council of Education Ministers (CEM). Such reports will be sent to Premiers and the press.
 
 
Priority 2: We must break the back of illiteracy among adults and youths in five years
No adult South African citizen should be illiterate in the 21st century, but millions will be unless we mobilise a social movement to bring reading, writing and numeracy to those who do not have it. At present, millions of South African adults and young people cannot read or write in any language, and millions more are functionally illiterate and innumerate, that is they cannot put their reading and writing skills to any useful purpose, and cannot manipulate numerical concepts. 
In modern society illiteracy excludes people from avenues of learning and communication, improved job skills and many normal responsibilities of citizenship. It is an alienating and disempowering thing, and increases dependence on others. For these reasons, many adults who are illiterate and innumerate are ashamed of their condition, and try to hide it.
Literacy is not an easy skill to retain. It can be lost or rendered ineffective through disuse. Our new Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET) Programme transcends literacy. It targets learning outcomes that empower, rather than leading to a dead end. Its learning programmes give qualifications that carry credit in the National Qualifications Framework. This enables adult learners to proceed with formal education, by self-study or otherwise. The Multi-Year Implementation Plan for ABET will enable close to a million new learners to achieve the equivalent of Grade 9 by 2003, provided the funds can be found and ABET practitioners trained.
We must support this programme as much as possible. Unfortunately, budgetary pressure has resulted in several provincial education departments cutting back or closing ABET programmes when they should have been expanding. This trend ought to be reversed, but it is improbable that the government will find sufficient additional funds in the near future to eliminate illiteracy through formal ABET programmes run by provincial education departments.
Another strategy is needed.
Firstly, all employers, including employers in national, provincial and local governments, must be encouraged to run or support ABET programmes for their employees. Many do so already, and some are leaders in ABET provision. But a major opportunity opens up through the introduction of the skills levy, and the establishment of Sector Education and Training Authorities under the National Skills Authority. I will consult the Minister of Labour with a view to ensuring that we target a massive increase in ABET provision through this route. Illiterate citizens who are not in employment would also have access to ABET programmes through the National Skills Fund.
Secondly, we must stimulate the civic virtue of voluntary service, in support of our illiterate compatriots. I extend an open invitation to all religious, political, social, educational and community formations to help us design a major programme of voluntary service on behalf of literacy and numeracy, and make facilities available to run it. Students, especially in secondary schools, further education and training institutions and higher education, will have a brilliant opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to community service by becoming literacy practitioners. My Ministry will be consulting on this matter with the National Youth Commission.
Even voluntary service requires funds to meet overhead and other costs. Given the scale of the need, such funds might be considerable. Once the programme has been planned and costed, I will appeal to national and international grant-making agencies to assist. The National Development Agency should have a strategic role in providing support to participating NGOs. 
Priority 3: Schools must become centres of community life
The crisis in primary and secondary schools must be dealt with by ensuring that schools become the centres of community life. 
The school will truly become a centre of community and cultural life if its facilities are being put to use for youth and adult learning, community meetings, music and drama, sports and recreation. An idle school is a vulnerable place, inviting vandalism. A busy school is a place the community will protect, because it is theirs. There is a role in a community school for religious bodies, businesses, cultural groups, sports clubs and civic associations, both to serve their own requirements and to contribute to the school's learning programme both in and out of school hours.
The school governing body, led by parents, exercises a trust on behalf of the parents of the community, and functions as the indispensable link between the school and the community. It must not be forgotten that this is a new concept for most communities in the country. We must therefore put great effort into ensuring that governing bodies, especially in poor communities, are given the support they need to become strong and viable. The Ministry of Education has an interest in ensuring that all public school governing bodies become members of governing body associations, which can represent them in dealing with the education authorities, and provide valuable technical support to their members. We will assist bona fide established or new governing body associations to access funds to support their organisational costs and outreach work.
The school principal, who represents the provincial department of education and is head of the school management team, has the crucial role of professional and administrative leadership, and is responsible for the standard of learning and teaching in the school. The principal needs to forge a working partnership with the governing body, so that they can jointly serve the vision and mission of the school in the community. Both parties require guidance in exercising their respective roles. It is therefore important that the school leadership team, headed by the principal, and the governing body in each public school, is given the opportunity to create the sense of common purpose and mutual support.
A functioning school is a true community in its own right, and an indispensable centre for the wider community's social and cultural needs and interests. But for this to happen, we need peace and stability in schools and in the environment of schools. Schools must therefore be rendered safe for learners, teachers, staff and the public. There must be regulations to restrict access only to those who have legitimate business in the school. Schools need to forge links with police stations, and join Community Policing Forums.
Public schools must be reclaimed from those who are violent in word or deed. Only in conditions of peace can discipline flourish. The law and order approach may bring about pacification, but it will not bring peace. Peace must be internally generated. In a society that is prone to violence, the peaceful settlement of disputes must be taught, and acted out in the society of the school. Values, morality and decency must be reinstated as the bedrock of school life, and self-discipline as the basis of disciplinary codes in the school. Corporal punishment is contrary to the Constitution and the South African Schools Act. In the past it has contributed to the culture of violence in our society. Parents, teachers and learners need help to understand why it has been prohibited, and to work out more effective substitutes.
Discipline in a community school will require that teaching starts on the first day of term. School must start on time and end on time, from Monday to Friday every week of the school year.
It would be incompatible with the notion of "community", as well as a denial of basic rights, if public schools ignored their responsibility to children with special needs, and their parents. Public schools should be, by definition, inclusive, humane and tolerant communities. The Ministry's long-awaited policy on education for learners with special needs will shortly be ready for publication. Schools must be assisted to create an enabling environment for parents whose children have physical disabilities or other special needs, so that early identification can result in appropriate advice and placement. To the greatest extent compatible with the interests of such children, the ordinary public school in the community should welcome them and provide for them. 
A mobilisation in support of the community school idea will give a boost to the Culture of Learning, Teaching and Service (COLTS) campaign, whole school development programmes, and a new programme launched by President Mbeki to forge partnerships for school improvement with poorly functioning but well-motivated public schools.
Priority 4: We must end conditions of physical degradation in South African schools
Although the government has contributed more than R1 billion to the National School Building Programme, it may require twelve times that amount to meet the backlogs identified in the School Register of Needs. This is well beyond the reach of the normal budgets of provincial education departments, which in recent years have suffered sharp decreases in the funds allocated to school building and services.
Nevertheless, millions of school children in democratic South Africa are required by circumstances to exercise their fundamental right to basic education in conditions of squalor and degradation. Thousands of schools have poor physical fabric, and many are dangerous and unfit for human habitation. Hundreds of schools have no water on site, no sanitation whatsoever, or rudimentary and insufficient toilets. Such conditions threaten the health of learners and teachers alike, and radically restrict the social and teaching activities of the school. It is impossible to contemplate this with complacency. The situation cries out for remedy. 
I will use every opportunity to press the priority of public spending on replacing dangerous and dilapidated schools, and providing water and sanitation services where they do not exist. It will be necessary to prioritise and target the areas and schools where the need is greatest, working with the provincial education departments. This could be a major project under the new Integrated Rural Development Programme announced by President Mbeki, working in partnership with other state departments, provincial authorities, parastatals and NGOs. Bringing water and sanitation in schools offers scope for a labour-intensive, community-based project. My Department has begun the initial planning work. 
Priority 5: We must develop the professional quality of our teaching force
All the evidence provided to me indicates that there is a real malaise in the teaching corps of this country, notwithstanding the high levels of professional service which teachers provide in schools all over the land. 
The provision of teachers in schools under apartheid resulted in two serious social distortions. One was the extreme inequality in learner-educator ratios that were sustained by unequal budget allocations based on racial and ethnic discrimination. It is bitterly unfortunate that teachers have borne the brunt of a process of rationalisation that, for the first time, allocates teachers equitably to schools according to curriculum needs. However, there is every prospect of job security for all qualified and registered teachers who are currently employed, and a return to stable staffing in our schools.
The second serious distortion was the racially-defined qualification structure, linked to racially-defined opportunities for training, which ensured that African teachers, taken as a whole, are less well qualified than other teachers. These less qualified teachers also teach, predominantly, in schools with poor facilities, inadequate learning resources, greater isolation from urban centres, and infrequent or no professional support services.
Professional development for teachers, combined with effective professional support services, the efficient provision of learning support materials, a mobilisation campaign to make the school the centre of community life, and the progressive elimination of inhuman physical conditions in schools, will make a major impact on teachers' morale and the quality of the service they render.
The Ministry of Education will give top priority to develop and implement a long-range plan for teacher development, both pre-service and in-service, in support of outcomes based education and improved standards of teaching. President Mbeki put this at the head of his list of government commitments in education. Special attention will need to be given to the compelling evidence that the country has a critical shortage of mathematics, science and language teachers, and to the demands of the new information and communication technologies.
In order to recognise outstanding teachers at all levels of the system, I will establish a National Teacher Award scheme, after consultation with the South African Council for Educators, the national teacher unions, and the provincial education departments.
I will also give priority to the preparation of a green paper on professional standards in education, as part of the process of enabling the South African Council for Educators to take its full place as a statutory professional body with real influence on the quality of service provision.
All these measures will help to realign the identity of the teacher in South African society. The years of discrimination, repression, struggle, and democratic transition have taken their toll, on teachers in all communities. It is time to re-assert the dignity of the teaching profession, because teachers at their best are vital agents of change and growth in our schools and communities.
Priority 6: We must ensure the success of active learning through outcomes-based education
The government and the Minister of Education give complete support to the new national curriculum framework based on the concept of outcomes based education. Curriculum 2005 represents our best hope of transforming the retrograde inheritance of apartheid-era learning theories and obsolete teaching practices. 
It is important to recognise what damage was done over the decades by an approach to education that was essentially authoritarian and allowed little or no room for the development of critical capacity or the power of independent thought and enquiry. Outcomes based education is an approach that embraces the capacity of learners to think for themselves, to learn from the environment, and to respond to wise guidance by teachers who value creativity and self-motivated learning.
While giving unreserved support to the approach, the Ministry of Education will resist over-zealous attempts from any quarter to convert OBE into a new orthodoxy with scriptural authority. There will be no mystification of an approach to learning and teaching that is essentially liberatory and creative.
I have directed that the Department of Education undertake a speedy review of the implementation of outcomes based education, with a view to the phasing of the introduction of new grades. 
I have also established as a target performance indicator that all children will achieve competence in reading, writing and numeracy skills by age 9, or the end of Grade 3. The Department of Education will take advice on the appropriate formulation of this standard and the manner of its implementation. It is essential to put in place a strong scaffolding for the new curriculum framework. The Department is working on appropriate key tests of learning attainment at grades 6 and 9.
It is fully recognised that the success of the implementation of the new approach is entirely dependent on the extent to which teachers are properly prepared to facilitate it with understanding, and the extent to which appropriate learning support materials are in the schools.
It was unfortunate in the extreme that the inaugural year of Curriculum 2005 (1998) coincided with the crisis in provincial budget management, with the result that the preparation of most provincial education departments was seriously compromised, or even disrupted. In both 1998 and 1999, new materials in support of the curriculum reached the schools late in the year, despite President Mandela's directive.
The specification, ordering, delivery and retention of learning support materials is a critical factor in the current crisis of school education, for which urgent solutions will be found. A business review of the entire process in all nine provinces is nearing completion. I have directed that the results are made known to both the Minister of Finance and myself, so that effective follow-up can be considered with the least possible delay. The target that all schools must receive their materials before the first day of school is not negotiable. We will find the way to ensure that provincial education departments are empowered to make it happen.
It is important to ensure that the large sums that are needed for learning support materials each year are wisely spent and represent the kind of value for money that is appropriate to our circumstances as a middle-income country with a majority of poor citizens. I have therefore directed that a study be undertaken of the costs of producing learning support materials, after consultation with the publishers and suppliers.
The retention of books in schools is a vital ingredient in keeping costs down and keeping learning up. All parents, principals and governing bodies must be made aware of their responsibilities to ensure that this aspect of discipline is strongly enforced, with appropriate sanctions. I commend the Congress of South African Students for launching Operation Mazibuye, which aims to use advocacy and persuasion at school and community level to achieve the same result, both for school books and other school property that may have been removed from schools. This campaign deserves total support.
 
 
 
Priority 7: We must create a vibrant further education and training system to equip youth and adults to meet the social and economic needs of the 21st century
Further education and training (FET), as the name implies, is the post-compulsory sector that precedes higher education. It includes education in senior secondary schools, technical colleges, community colleges and youth colleges, and much training at this level by employers within commerce and industry. Private providers are highly active in this field, and will be subject to regulation under the Further Education and Training Act, 1998.
As a bridge between general education and higher education or employment, this is a vital sector for young people and adults whose formal education has been cut short. The policy has been settled and the legislation is in place. We must now get on with implementation, in close co-operation with the Department of Labour and the South African Qualifications Authority, since the establishment of the Sector Education and Training Authorities opens up exciting opportunities for further education and training institutions. 
There is an urgent need to review all FET programmes in the light of community social and economic needs in the 21st century. Language programmes, mathematics and science, and information and communication technologies are priority areas for review.
It is essential for the FET sector to be as accessible as possible to adult learners who were unable to continue their education because of poverty or lack of opportunity. The sector must set itself the goal of becoming leading practitioners in the assessment and recognition of prior learning, gained informally or through experience, so that able and experienced adults may be admitted to programmes from which they could benefit.
Work on the replacement of the Senior Certificate examination by a Further Education and Training Certificate will be taken forward with all necessary speed. In the mean time, it is essential for fail-safe mechanisms to be put in place to guarantee the security of the present Senior Certificate examination process, and avoid the slightest possibility of criminal manipulation of the marks by anyone. The South African Certification Council (SAFCERT) has been directed to certify the results independently before they are announced to the public by provincial examination authorities. I will introduce amending legislation in Parliament this year to clarify the responsibilities of this important statutory body and ensure that in future there is no uncertainty about its role. 
Priority 8: We must implement a rational, seamless higher education system that grasps the intellectual and professional challenges facing South Africans in the 21st century
The country depends on the higher education system to meet its high level human resource needs and to be the engine for the creation of new knowledge and innovation, and critical discourse. Given the magnitude of our other priorities, it is unlikely that significant additional resources will be available for higher education, which already receives 14 per cent of the education budget, a proportion well in line with international spending in this area. 
It is important, however, that funding levels to the sector are sustained, while institutions become more efficient and accountable for the utilisation of their intellectual, infrastructural and financial resources.
Like schools, our universities, technikons and colleges must become vibrant centres of community and cultural life. 
They must provide a safe and secure environment conducive to promoting their mission of teaching and learning, scholarship and research, and community service. Violence of any sort and especially violence against women will not be tolerated. University and technikon residences must be reclaimed as safe learning and living spaces, particularly for women students.
I am very pleased to report that the student leadership in higher education, across a wide political spectrum, have committed themselves to peace and stability in the sector. 
I expect higher education managers to run their institutions in a responsible and inclusive manner, which means engaging in good faith consultation with SRCs and staff associations. Provided that they do so, I expect student and staff bodies to exhaust all local remedies on their own campuses before contemplating an appeal to the Minister. 
Similarly, I will expect institutional councils to account for their legal and fiduciary responsibilities. I take seriously the responsibility to nominate certain members on each institutional council. I will be reviewing the appointment and performance of such Ministerial nominees, from whom I expect a report on their contribution to good governance in these institutions.
The shape and size of the higher education system cannot be left to chance if we are to realise the vision of a rational, seamless higher education system, responsive to the needs of students of all ages and the intellectual challenges of the 21st century.
The institutional landscape of higher education will be reviewed as a matter of urgency in collaboration with the Council on Higher Education. This landscape was largely dictated by the geo-political imagination of apartheid planners. As our policy documents make clear, it is vital that the mission and location of higher education institutions be re-examined with reference to both the strategic plan for the sector, and the educational needs of local communities and the nation at large in the 21st century. 
This complex and difficult exercise is likely to result in mergers between some institutions, and decisions to change the missions of others. It is well known that institutions find it very difficult to come to such decisions on their own. Provided the investigation has been thorough and consultation has been undertaken fully and in good faith, I will not hesitate to take the necessary action with all deliberate speed.
I am committed to the wise and full development of the public higher education system. I will not be party to inadvertent damage to this system, or to public interests, brought about by an unduly generous interpretation of the regulations for the registration of private higher education institutions. The proliferation of such institutions, both local and trans-national, has become part of the unfolding South African higher education landscape, as it has in other countries. This must now be brought under strict but considered regulation, consistent with the Constitution. I will undertake an urgent review of the criteria and procedures for registration in terms of the Higher Education Act, 1997. I will also seek international advice on the management of the private, corporate and "borderless" higher education phenomenon, and its relationship to strategic human resource development planning
Enrolments in public higher education institutions have declined in the past few years. The reasons need to be better understood. The long-term sustainability of individual institutions and the system as a whole requires that growth be promoted in a planned and responsible manner. As part of the ongoing planning process, I will be asking all universities and technikons to inform me of their intake targets for the year 2000 and the recruitment strategies for attaining these targets. These must include a commitment to the recruitment of mature age learners, and the application of procedures for the recognition of prior learning. 
While the student composition of higher education institutions has changed significantly over the past few years to better reflect the demographic realities of the broader society, the same cannot be said for the composition of the academic staff in higher education, which largely remains white and male. I will be giving close attention to promoting greater staff equity in the system through an investigation of staff conditions of employment and related matters. Institutions must be challenged to set targets to progressively achieve greater representation of women and black academic staff, as part of their institutional plans. 

The higher education system will also be called upon to play a central role in the building of capacity for the education system as a whole. In particular its resources must be mobilised to support quality pre-service and in-service teacher education and educational management capacity building. Our faculties and schools of education have an exceptional opportunity to inform educational policy and practice throughout the education system through research, critical reflection and innovation. 
I am committed to building a responsive higher education system of high quality. We have much to do. I will ask universities, technikons and colleges to provide me with evidence to show that they are indeed on the road to the 21st century.
Priority 9: We must deal urgently and purposefully with the HIV/AIDS emergency in and through the education and training system
This is the priority that underlies all priorities, for unless we succeed, we face a future full of suffering and loss, with untold consequences for our communities and the education institutions that serve them.
The Ministry of Education will work alongside the Ministry of Health to ensure that the national education system plays its part to stem the epidemic, and to ensure that the rights of all persons infected with the HIV virus are fully protected.

The strategic plan for South African agriculture is the product of cooperation between Government, Agri SA and NAFU.
Early in 2001 President Thabo Mbeki requested the different role-players to identify a mutual strategy that would provide enough focus to unite the sector. From this request followed the strategic sector plan.
The vision for the sector implies sustained profitable participation in the South African agricultural economy by all stakeholders. It recognises the need to maintain and increase commercial production, to build international competitiveness and to address the historical legacies and biases that resulted in skewed access and representation. It gives a clear picture of where South African agriculture wants to be in the long term.
The strategic plan consists of three core strategies:
 Equitable access and participation
The objectives of this strategy are to enhance equitable access to and participation in agricultural opportunities; to deracialise land and enterprise ownership; and to unlock the full entrepreneurial potential in the sector.
 Global competitiveness and profitability
The aim of this strategy is to enhance profitability through sustained global competitiveness in the agricultural sector's input supply, primary production, agriprocessing and agritourism industries.
 Sustainable resource management
This strategy aims to enhance farmers' capacities to use resources in a sustainable manner and to ensure the wise use and management of natural resources.
Some elements of the core strategies are complementary and will contribute towards creating and restoring confidence in agriculture. With this in mind, the task team identified a number of essential supporting and enabling strategies:
 Good governance
 Integrated and sustainable rural development
 Knowledge and innovation
 International cooperation
 Safety and security
These complementary strategic objectives provide the critical foundation without which the strategic goal will not be realised. They also emphasise the dependence of the sector on the support of other government cluster departments and industries.
The partners who have tasked themselves with the responsibility for the plan's implementation will also produce the detailed action plans. To this end, the leading partners will establish the permanent joint committee. They are also making an effort to involve organised labour, NGOs, community-based organisations and foreign organisations.
As a first step to move the strategic plan closer to implementation, the strategic partners identified the following priority programmes and actions:
 Implementing the broad-based safety and security strategy for good working and social stability, trust and confidence
 Fostering a shared vision on agriculture, good governance and social partnerships
 Fast tracking the programme of land redistribution for agricultural development and processes of empowerment for targeted groups
 Transforming agricultural research, transfer of technology, education and extension to be more responsive to markets
 Redefining the mandate of agricultural marketing and international trade in the post-control board era against greater global competition and demands for market access, infrastructure and information
 Building credible agricultural statistical and economic analysis systems that will be accessible to all farmers and enterprises
 Establishing the integrated rural financial services system outlined by the Strauss Commission Report
 Developing an effective integrated risk management system for plant and animal health systems, price and income systems and natural disasters
 Targeting investment in rural development nodes to provide livelihoods, infrastructure, irrigation, electricity, telecommunications, transportation, training and skills development
 Establishing an agricultural cooperation programme for Africa to spearhead the New Africa Initiative in agriculture
 Lowering the overall cost of production, including a further reduction in the taxes and duties on diesel and other inputs.
In all of this, they recognise the valuable role of the private sector in achieving the goals of participation, competitiveness and sustainability.
Therefore everything will be done to ensure greater collaboration and coordination between government and the private sector-implying farmers, farmers' organisations and agribusiness-in order to attain the new vision of a united and prosperous agricultural sector.
The following outcomes are expected from the successful pursuit of these strategic objectives:
 Increased wealth creation in agriculture and rural areas
 Increased sustainable employment in agriculture
 Increased incomes and increased foreign exchange earnings
 Reduced poverty and inequalities in land and enterprise ownership
 Improved farming efficiency
 Improved national and household food security
 Stable and safe rural communities, reduced levels of crime and violence, and sustained rural development
 Improved investor confidence and greater domestic and foreign investment in agricultural activities and rural areas
 Pride and dignity in agriculture as an occupation and sector
The partners commit themselves to providing the necessary time and financial and material resources to see to the successful implementation of the strategic plan.

 WHAT IS THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS?


* The ANC is a national liberation movement. It was formed in 1912 to unite the African people and spearhead the struggle for fundamental political, social and economic change. 
* For nine decades the ANC has led the struggle against racism and oppression, organising mass resistance, mobilising the international community and taking up the armed struggle against apartheid. 
* The ANC achieved a decisive democratic breakthrough in the 1994 elections, where it was given a firm mandate to negotiate a new democratic Constitution for South Africa. The new Constitution was adopted in 1996. 
* The ANC was re-elected in 1999 to national and provincial government with an increased mandate. 
* The policies of the ANC are determined by its membership and its leadership is accountable to the membership. 
* Membership of the ANC is open to all South Africans above the age of 18 years, irrespective of race, colour and creed, who accept its principles, policies and programmes. 
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
* The ANC's key objective is the creation of a united, non-racial, non-sexist and democratic society. 
* This means the liberation of Africans in particular and black people in general from political and economic bondage. It means uplifting the quality of life of all South Africans, especially the poor. 
* The struggle to achieve this objective is called the National Democratic Revolution. 
ANC POLICY
The Freedom Charter, which was adopted by the Congress of the People in 1955, remains the basic policy document of the ANC.
The Freedom Charter declares that:
* The people shall govern 
* All national groups shall have equal rights 
* The people shall share in the country's wealth 
* The land shall be shared among those who work it 
* All shall be equal before the law 
* All shall enjoy equal human rights 
* There shall be work and security 
* The doors of learning and culture shall be opened 
* There shall be houses, security and comfort 
* There shall be peace and friendship 
In 1994 the ANC adopted the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) as the basic policy framework guiding the ANC in the transformation of South Africa. The key programmes of the RDP are:
* meeting basic needs 
* developing our human resources 
* building the economy 
* democratising the state and society 
SYMBOLS OF THE ANC
* The flag of the ANC is made of equal horizontal bands of black, green and gold. The black symbolises the people of South Africa who, for generations, have fought for freedom. The green represents the land, which sustained our people for centuries and from which they were removed by colonial and apartheid governments. The gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa, which belongs to all its people, but which has been used to benefit only a small racial minority. 
* The logo contains a spear and shield to represent the early wars of resistance to colonial rule, the armed struggle of the ANC's former armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and the ANC's ongoing struggle against racial privilege and oppression. The wheel dates back to the campaign for the Congress of the People, which adopted the Freedom Charter, and marks the joining in a common struggle for freedom people from all South Africa's communities. It is a symbol of the strong non-racial traditions of the ANC. The fist holding the spear represents the power of a people united in struggle for freedom and equality. 
* The ANC's rallying call Amandla ngawethu or Matla ke arona means 'power to the people', reflecting the central demand of the Freedom Charter that the people shall govern. It a statement of the ANC's commitment to build and deepen popular democracy and the active involvement of the people in the struggle to improve their lives 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF AN ANC MEMBER
The values and principles of an ANC member include: 
* humility and a selfless dedication to the struggle for a non-racial, non-sexist and democratic society, 
* concern for the will and interests of the people, captured in the principles of Batho Pele - people first, 
* a commitment to implement the policies of the movement and the decisions of the collective. 
Members of the ANC are expected to: 
* belong to an ANC branch, pay subscription fees and assist in building the ANC, 
* participate actively in the discussion, formulation and implementation of ANC policy and programmes, 
* accept and defend the decisions of the relevant structures of the movement, 
* build the unity of the ANC and democratic movement and combat corruption, nepotism and factionalism, 
* fight against racism, tribal chauvinism, sexism, religious and political intolerance or any form of discrimination, 
* constantly remain informed of political and other developments, building their own capabilities as part of a process of life-long learning, 
* remain in touch with the people and play an active role in the affairs of the community, 
* behave in an exemplary way in day-to-day life, and not use positions of responsibility for self-enrichment or personal gain. 
STRUCTURES OF THE ANC
* The Branch is the basic unit of the ANC, where members participate in ANC activities and political discussions. The branch is the 'vanguard' of the community, representing its interests, expressing its aspirations and mobilising it to work together for local development. Each branch elects a Branch Executive Committee at an Annual General Meeting. 
* The Regional Executive Committee (REC) is elected at a Regional Conference every two years by the representatives of the branches in the region. 
* The Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is elected at a Provincial Conference every three years by the representatives of the branches in the province. 
* The National Executive Committee (NEC) is the highest organ of the ANC between Conferences and has the responsibility to lead the organisation. It is elected every five years at the National Conference. The NEC elects a National Working Committee (NWC) from within its ranks to coordinate the work of the organisation on a day-to-day basis. 
* The National Conference, which takes place every five years, is the highest decision-making body of the ANC. Branch representatives comprise at least 90 percent of voting delegates at the National Conference. A National General Council (NGC) is held between National Conferences to evaluate the programme of the movement. 
* The ANC Women's League functions as an autonomous body within the overall structure of the ANC. Its objective is to defend and advance the rights of women against all forms of oppression and to ensure that women play a full role in the life of the organisation. The Women's League is open to all women who are members of the ANC. 
* The ANC Youth League also functions as an autonomous body, with the objective of uniting and leading young people in confronting and dealing with the problems that face the youth, and in ensuring that the youth make a full and rich contribution to the work of the ANC. Membership of the Youth League is open to all people between the ages of 14 and 35. 
THE TRIPARTITE ALLIANCE
The ANC is in an alliance with the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). Each Alliance partner is an independent organisation with its own constitution, membership and programmes. The Alliance is founded on a common commitment to the objectives of the National Democratic Revolution, and the need to unite the largest possible cross-section of South Africans behind these objectives. 
WHERE TO FIND THE ANC
Branches of the ANC are to be found in every city, town and village in South Africa. The ANC has a national headquarters, nine provincial offices and several regional offices.

Anthrax

Anthrax is a highly contagious disease of domestic and wild animals which can affect humans
* Animals usually die suddenly without any symptoms of illness 
* There is, however, an effective vaccine to prevent the disease 
* The correct handling of affected carcasses will also prevent the spread of the disease 
What causes anthrax? 
The disease is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. When animals die of anthrax and particularly when carcasses are cut open, resistant spores are formed which can survive in the soil for many years. The bloody discharge from the nostrils, mouth and anus, as well as skin, bone and other tissue is important in the spreading of the disease. 

Scavengers, vultures and even flies play 
an important role in the spreading of these 
resistant spores. Runoff water can also disperse 
the spores to pans or dams and create concentrated 
sources of infection in other areas.

The infection is usually acquired by drinking contaminated 
water, grazing on contaminated pastures or when animals 
lick contaminated skins, bones, blood or carcasses.

Can animals or humans be treated for the disease? 
* Animals often die before the disease can be diagnosed or the animals treated 
* Humans and resistant animals, such as pigs, dogs and horses can, however, be treated with antibiotics 
Consult your doctor if contact with anthrax is suspected 
Control
Animals 
* Vaccinate livestock annually against anthrax 
* Do not cut open carcasses of animals which have died if anthrax is suspected 
* Bury these carcasses at a depth of at least 2 metres and treat the soil liberally with chloride of lime 
* Carcasses may also be burnt without cutting them open 
* Report suspected cases immediately to the nearest animal health technician or state veterinarian 
* The state veterinarian may prescribe methods to disinfect the premises, transport vehicles and other products 
Humans 
* The carcasses of affected animals should never be eaten!! 
* Avoid direct contact with a carcass of an animal suspected to have died of anthrax. Always wear protective clothing when the carcass is buried or burnt 
What are the symptoms of anthrax?
* Animals may die within 2 hours without showing any signs of illness (sudden death)  
* Fever 
* Difficult breathing 
* Muscle tremors and redness of the mucous membranes may be observed 
* Blood-stained discharge from the nostrils, mouth and anus 
* Advanced cases may have a swelling of the throat and neck. This could lead to breathing problems and difficulty in swallowing 
How can anthrax be diagnosed? 
Anthrax is diagnosed by microscopic examination of a bloodsmear. Consult your local veterinarian or animal health technician in this regard

Never cut open the carcass or eat the meat of an animal that has died suddenly!! 

How do humans contract the disease?
* Direct contact with affected animals or animal products 
* Inhaling dust which contains spores 
* Ingesting infected meat 
Although people normally contract a skin form of the disease, death may occur in humans as a result of anthrax 
Anthrax can be prevented with the cooperation of every farmer!!
If anthrax is suspected carcasses should never be handled, cut open or eaten!!

A census in our schools
 
During September/October, children throughout South Africa will be taking part in an exciting project, called CensusAtSchool. 
 
CensusAtSchool is being run by Statistics South Africa, our official statistics agency, and the Department of Education. It will involve both teachers and learners, working together in their classrooms. Children will, under the guidance of teachers, gather information about themselves, their school and their home environment. The information gathered will become an important part of a national and international database, with similar information being provided from countries like the United Kingdom and Australia, which are busy with a similar project. 
 
This data will be used to develop teaching materials to help learners like your child to understand statistics and the way in which they can be used. CensusAtSchool will also help children to understand the importance of the national population census, which takes place in October. This year's population census is known as Census 2001.
 
What is a population census? 
In South Africa, a population census takes place every five years. During the census, every person in the country is counted, and information is gathered about how and where people live. This information (which statisticians call data) is used by government departments, local authorities and planners to decide where resources are most needed. 
 
This means that information collected in the population census is used to decide where schools and clinics should be built, which areas need better transport, and where piped water and electricity should be supplied. Data gathered in the population census is also used to decide where resources should be directed for rural development, urban upgrading and poverty relief.   
 
Why take part in Census 2001?
* ·        Funds for your community. By taking part in the census, you will help your community get the funding that it needs for services and development.
* ·        Disaster management. Census information will help health providers to predict the spread of diseases such as cholera. In the case of floods, census information will advise rescue and emergency services where the help is needed most urgently, and how many people need assistance.
* ·        Improved services. Census data tells planners where new schools, clinics and social services are needed.
* ·        Make government work for you. Census 2001 is a good way to tell our leaders who we are and what we need. Information from the census is used to help decide where government funds are spent.
* ·        Help your family. Census numbers will assist government to plan and implement programmes and services for the immediate future. Data from the census also lays the foundation for planning in the future. Better long-term planning will benefit both you and your children.   
 
When is Census 2001?
People specially employed and trained to collect information, known as enumerators, will visit your household between 10 and 31 October 2001.

PREAMBLE
In the light of: 
* the existing discrimination against persons with AIDS or HIV and their partners, families and care-givers. 
* the danger that the growth of the epidemic in South Africa will lead to an increase in unfair and irrational treatment of those affected by AIDS and HIV 
* the desirability of greater awareness and knowledge of AIDS and HIV among all South Africans, and 
* the need for concerted action by all South Africans to stop the spread of HIV 
this Charter sets out those basic rights which all citizens enjoy or should enjoy and which should not be denied to persons affected by HIV or AIDS as well as certain duties.
1     LIBERTY, AUTONOMY, SECURITY OF THE PERSON AND FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT 
1.1   Persons with HIV or AIDS have the same rights to liberty and autonomy, security of the person and to freedom of movement as the rest of the population.
1.2    No restriction should be placed on the free movement of persons within and between states on the ground of HIV or AIDS.
1.3    Segregation, isolation or quarantine of persons in prisons, schools, hospitals or elsewhere merely on the grounds of AIDS or HIV is unacceptable.
1.4    Persons with HIV or AIDS are entitled to autonomy in decisions regarding marriage and child-bearing although counselling about the consequences of their decisions should be provided.
2    CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY
2.1   Persons with HIV or AIDS have the right to confidentiality and privacy concerning their health and HIV status.
2.2   Information regarding a person's HIV status must not be disclosed without that person's consent, and, after death, except when required by law, without the consent of his or her family or partner, except in cases of clear threat to and disregard of an identifiable individual's life interests.
3    TESTING
3.1   HIV antibody testing must occur with free and informed consent, except in the case of unlinked, anonymous epidemiological screening programmes.
3.2   Anonymous and confidential HIV antibody testing with pre- and post-test counselling should be available to all.
3.3   Persons who test HIV positive should have access to continuing support and health services.
4    EDUCATION ON AIDS AND HIV
4.1   All persons have the right to proper education and full information about HIV and AIDS, as well as the right to full access to and information about prevention methods.
4.2   Public education with the specific objective of eliminating discrimination against persons with HIV or AIDS should be provided.

What exactly is a Domain Name?

Like a telephone number, a Domain name is a unique Identifier that points to a certain site on the World Wide Web. Each computer on the Internet has a unique numeric Internet Protocol address such as 131.215.3.29 . These numbers are not user-friendly and give no indication as to what this address contains. 
A domain name is a mnemonic that is not only a lot easier to remember but that could also indicate what the Web Site contains. It is easier to remember old-books.co.za than 121.202.7.23 and, if you are a collector of old books, you have a fair idea that this site will contain information that you would find interesting. 
Typically, Domain Names operate like telephone dialing codes in reverse. The first portion of the name points to a specific site, the second points to the broad category the site falls in and the third portion is the country code where the site is registered. For example, absa.co.za refers to Absa Bank's Web site. This site is registered in the commercial (co) domain in South Africa (za). 
In all countries there are Domain Name Servers, computers that will take the Domain Name and look up the relevant Internet Protocol Address and feed this address back to your computer so that it can connect with the site you wish to visit. 
Why should I register a Domain Name?

Every year companies spend millions building up names or brands and images linked to these names. It is sensible to register this name and to protect the branded investment and to give Internet Customers a Domain Name they know. 
This is more so the case where a company's name is a generic word with other meanings or uses. This is a powerful brand name that most people immediately link to database systems but there is nothing preventing a spiritual medium from registering a website under this name and providing prophecies. Such a medium would be proven correct if they prophesied that a certain IT Company would soon be offering him a vast sum of money for his Domain Name. 
In the case of well-known registered trademarks and brand names, a company may resort to legal steps to retrieve such names from any person that has wrongfully registered the name as a Domain Name. Even this could involve litigation, an expensive and time-consuming exercise. Compare this to the cost of registering a Domain Name in South Africa's co.za domain, a mere R200 (VAT inclusive) for the first year. 
How do I register my Domain Name?

Although it is possible for any person or company to register a Domain name directly with the administrators of a specific domain, it is advisable to elicit the services of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
Registering a Domain Name is only the first step to participation in one of the largest emerging marketplaces. A registered domain name is nothing more than an address and, if visitors should turn up at this address a few times only to see "UNDER CONSTRUCTION", chances are that they may never return. Internet Service Providers are professionals who would offer guidance through the process of registration and advice on all matters regarding setting up a professional, attractive and successful Website. 
Can I choose any Domain Name?

What's in a name? Well, technically, the letters in the alphabet (A - Z) and the numbers (0 - 9) and the hyphen ( - ) may be used and there should be no more than 30 characters in the domain name. The technical limit is 256 characters but we have imposed a practical limit of 30 characters. 
Having said that, however, it is important to remember that the domain name may be used as part of the URL to access your web page or as part of an e-mail address. Whether the domain name is chosen for a Company's presence on the Web or for pleasure, the same guidelines and rules apply. 
Let's use a hypothetical example: I have taken over the family business "Michael Salibas and Sons". The business has been operating for several years and has an established and growing customer base. I decide to register a domain and put up a web page. I can either register MICHAELSALIBASANDSONS.CO.ZA or MSS.CO.ZA . 
The logo for my business cards and Letterheads has the letters "MSS" in a fancy flowing light blue font with a red line running across the letters. Why? Because it is CATCHY and people will REMEMBER it. The same rules apply to a domain name. It is easier to remember and "catchier" to have www.MSS.co.za than to have www.MICHAELSALIBASANDSONS.co.za . 
By the way, the domain MSS.CO.ZA is already registered and belongs to "Medical System Support(Pty)LTD" so I would have to come up with another Domain Name. 
How do I check if the Domain Name is available?

Now that a suitable Domain Name has been selected, it is advisable to check if it is available for registration by using the WHOIS SERVER on the CO.ZA web page http://co.za and typing in the Domain Name that is to be checked and hitting ENTER. If the Domain Name is available, then the web page will display something like this. The results below are for the Domain Name "tomjones.co.za" 


The CO.ZA simple whois server
Your query has generated the following reply:- 

Search on tomjones (.co.za)
Match: Zero
    Nothing matched - this should mean that
         the name is safe to use...
                


If, on the other hand, the Domain Name is taken by someone, the web page will display different results. The WHOIS SERVER will also provide the Contact Details for the particular Domain Name. This result is for the Domain Name "jones.co.za": 


The CO.ZA simple whois server
Your query has generated the following reply:- 

Search on jones (.co.za)
Match: One

                Domain: jones.co.za


                
Where do I find the Application Form?

Now that a Domain Name has been selected and checked that it is available for use, the next step is to Download the APPLICATION FORM. 
The Application Form can also be found on the CO.ZA web page http://co.za. This is not an Online Form so the form will have to be saved onto a Hard Drive. 
This can be done by Clicking on FILE and SAVE AS and Selecting the folder (or a Directory for all those NON-Windows people) where the file will be saved and clicking on SAVE. The file name can be renamed but it is advisable to leave the file name as is. 
What Information will I need to complete the Form?

The Contact Details for the Domain Owner, the Administrative Contact, and the Technical Contact for the Domain Name are required. The contact details will include Postal Addresses, Telephone numbers, and E-Mail Addresses. The E-Mail Address of the Organisation (or indiviual) that will be billed for the Registration is also required. 
There are two basic ways to register a Domain Name. The Domain Name can either be hosted with an ISP or a Hosting Company or the new Domain Name can be aliased to an existing Domain Name. 
If the Domain Name is to be used immediately then it is advisable to talk to one of the ISP's or Hosting Companies about hosting the Domain Name. Most ISP's will complete the Registration Form on the applicant's behalf. If the ISP or Hosting Company requires that the applicant submit the Registration Form, then the applicant should get the Nameserver Details from the ISP and ensure that the Domain Name is set up on the Nameservers that were provided by the ISP. 
If the Domain Name is to be reserved with the intention of using it at a later date, then an alias (CNAME) can be provided for the New Domain Name and up to two other aliases under the New Domain Name. The CNAME should be an Active Domain Name. A Domain Name should not be mistaken with a Virtual Web Space. For Example: geocities.com is a Domain Name; geocities.com/mike is a Virtual Web Space.

Food preparation
and
home food safety
1
o Bacteria and other organisms are
everywhere-on our hands, in the kitchen
and even in the air. These bacteria and
organisms can cause food-borne diseases
if food is not handled properly.
o Some of these diseases can cause death.
o When food leaves the grocery store, you, the consumer,
become an important link in the food-safety chain. Safely
processed foods can become unsafe if not handled
properly during transport and at home.
o The Directorate Veterinary Public Health regards illness as
a result of contaminated food as a major health hazard.
Contaminated food can be a hazard, especially to infants
and the elderly.
o To help you keep food safe, to reduce risk of food-borne
diseases and to protect your family, the following rules for
home food safety and food preparation must be followed:
Food preparation

Choose food processed for safety
Meat
o Buy your meat from trustworthy sources
such as wholesalers and butcheries who
get their meat from approved abattoirs.
o If you are not sure, look for the
"Approved/Goedgekeur" stamp
on each quarter of the carcass.
o It is good practice to take a cooler bag along
to the supermarket or shop when buying meat.
Milk
o Buy only pasteurised milk from
approved producers.
o Unpasteurised milk must be boiled before use.
Fruits and vegetables
o When you buy fresh fruits and vegetables,
wash them thoroughly before use.
Do not try to be brave,
be safe

Cook food thoroughly
o Food can be contaminated by disease-causing pathogens
or organisms.
o Freezing or rinsing food is not enough to destroy harmful
bacteria which may be present.
o Always cook
perishable foods
such as meat,
poultry, fish and eggs
right through to the middle
at a temperature of no less than 70 ?C.
o When cutting into
thoroughly cooked meat,
there should not be a trace
of pink juices.
Cook it right before you
take a bite
4
Thaw frozen food thoroughly
o Frozen food should be thawed
thoroughly before cooking. This
may take longer but will be safer.
o Always thaw or marinate meat,
poultry and seafood in the
refrigerator. Larger items may take
longer and it is therefore important
to plan ahead.
o To thaw foods faster, place in a leakproof
plastic bag and immerse into
cold water. Water can be changed
every 30 minutes to ensure that it
stays cold. After thawing in this way,
food should be refrigerated until it is
ready to use.
o When thawing food in a microwave
oven, it should be cooked
immediately thereafter, because
microwave-thawed food reaches
temperatures that encourage
bacterial growth.
Make it law-use the
fridge to thaw
5
Avoid keeping perishable foods at
room temperature too long
o Perishable foods
such as meat
and fish should
never be left at
room temperature
for more than
2 hours, including
preparation and
serving time.
o When meat or fish is left at room
temperature for more than
2 hours bacterial growth
can reach harmful levels and
the food may no longer be safe.
o Once fruits and vegetables are cut, it
is better to limit the time they are kept
at room temperature. On very hot
summer days, the time limit
decreases to 1 hour.

for you
6
Eat cooked foods immediately
o Try to eat cooked foods as soon
as possible after cooking.
o As soon as the cooked food starts
to cool down, microbes start to
grow, contaminating food.
Do not delay, eat food
straight away
Store cooked foods carefully
o Food can be stored either hot or cold. When
stored hot, it should be at a temperature
of not lower than 60 ?C. When stored cold,
food should be at a temperature of not
higher than -10 ?C. The "danger zone"
between these temperatures should be
avoided because this is when foodborne
bacteria multiply rapidly. These
bacteria can double in number in as
little as 20 minutes.
o Perishable foods such as meat, poultry and
fish should be taken home immediately
after purchase and stored in a refrigerator
or freezer at the temperature indicated.

o At events such as buffets, foods
should be placed over ice or a heat
source for added safety. If this is
not possible, set food out in smaller
bowls and set out fresh food as
needed.
Cool leftovers immediately
o Leftovers should be placed in the refrigerator
immediately (within 2 hours).
o Food should be placed in shallow
containers to cool down quickly.
o If the quantity of food is too large, it will not
cool down quickly enough in the middle.
o Remember that bacteria are everywhere
and that they can be reintroduced to
foods after cooking.

Hot or cool down to the bone,
avoid the danger zone
Do not get sick,
cool it quick
8
Avoid contact between raw and
cooked foods
o In the kitchen one
works with different
foods simultaneously.
It is important to keep these foods separate, especially raw
foods such as meat, eggs, fish and cooked foods, as
contamination can spread from the raw to
the cooked foods.
o Juices from raw foods such as meat and
seafood products should not come into
contact with foods already cooked or
foods that will be eaten raw, such
as salads.
Reheat cooked foods immediately
o During storage, the growth of
microbes is slowed down, but remember
that the microbes are not killed. It should
therefore be ensured that food is reheated
thoroughly through to the middle to a temperature of 70 ?C.
You need a complete
reheat
7
9
o After cutting raw meat or fish, clean the cutting board with
soapy water before cutting raw vegetables on the same
board. Packages with raw meat and fish should be placed
on lower shelves of the refrigerator to prevent their juices
from dripping onto other food.
Wash hands thoroughly
and repeatedly
o Hands should be washed before
working with food and after each interruption,
such as using the toilet or changing the baby.
o Hands should also be washed after handling raw foods such
as raw meat and fish.
o Bacteria can spread all over the kitchen if your hands are not
washed properly.
o Hands should therefore be washed with soap and warm water
before working with food and after each interruption.
SOAP
Watch that plate, do not
cross-contaminate
Do not be a dope,
wash with soap
10
Keep kitchen surfaces clean
o Kitchen surfaces should be cleaned regularly, especially
after working with raw foods such as raw meat.
o If these surfaces are contaminated, your food could be affected,
seriously damaging the health of your family.
o Dishcloths and cutlery should be kept clean as well.
Protect food from insects, rodents
and other animals
o Food should be stored in tightly
sealed containers where animals
and rodents cannot reach it.
o Animals are potential contaminators
and carry pathogenic micro-organisms.
Do not be mean, keep
your kitchen clean
7
Do it right, store foods
tight
11
Use clean water
o Clean water is important for drinking and food
preparation.
o This should be kept in mind especially with
regard to infants.
Remember
o Your family's health is important, therefore keep to these
easy-to-follow rules.
o Healthy food equals a healthy family. You are what you eat
in more ways than one.
o Bacteria responsible for food-borne diseases cannot be seen,
smelled or tasted.
o Food contamination mostly occurs after purchase; therefore
keep to these easy-to-follow rules.
o Whenever you are unsure about the safety of food and all
these rules have been followed, do not eat it.
Be sure that the water
is pure
When in doubt,
throw it out

MESSAGE FROM THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION 
Dear Friends and Colleagues 
This is an emergency 
There is good evidence that well over 3 million people in South Africa have HIV right now. The disease affects men and women of all ages, occupations and races living in all provinces. 
If the current rate of infection does not slow down, by the year 2010 one in every four people in the country will have HIV. In ten years the disease will have made orphans of three-quarters of a million South African children. 
Why is this happening? 
This booklet explains why. The HIV virus spreads from person to person in several ways, but the most common way is through sexual intercourse, when one partner is infected. The disease is spreading so fast mainly because many South Africans, especially men, are careless about their sexual behaviour. 
Most people who are infected do not know that they are carrying the HIV virus, because it stays in the body a long time before it makes someone ill. Thus infected people infect others without being aware of what they are doing. 
At present there is no medicine that can prevent us from being infected, and there is no cure for HIV/AIDS, which is a fatal disease. Some drugs seem to enable the body to defend itself against the disease, but these are expensive. They are not yet available to many people in our country. This means that the death rate from HIV/AIDS is still climbing rapidly among men and women of all ages, especially among sexually-active people. 
The impact of HIV/AIDS 
Many of us are scared by what is happening. Family members, relatives, friends and work-mates are falling ill and dying, often when they are quite young. Husbands, wives and infants are being struck down. People do not like to talk about the cause of death. It seems mysterious and shameful. 
The idea of one in four South Africans becoming sick with a fatal illness is too awful for us to grasp. We cannot imagine what this rising wave of illness and death will do to our families, our schools and other workplaces, and our communities. While our country is struggling to create jobs and overcome poverty, the epidemic is destroying the most productive members of our society. 
HIV/AIDS in schools 
Many schools are already experiencing the effects of the epidemic, as teachers, learners, and members of their families fall ill. Before the epidemic is brought under control, such effects will become harsher and more widespread. Almost every educator will eventually be teaching some learners who have HIV. In most staff rooms, one or more teachers will be infected. Other school employees will not be exempt.
Illness disrupts learning and teaching. Well teachers have to take on an extra load when sick teachers are absent. Learners who are ill fall behind with their studies. When family members get ill or die, teachers and learners carry the burden. When teachers and learners die, schools suffer disruption, loss and sorrow. Many schools will be crippled by the impact of the disease on staff, learners and their families. 
What can South Africans do? 
The problem seems overwhelming, but we can take the initiative. Working together we can resist the epidemic and deal with its consequences. Other countries in Africa, where the epidemic struck earlier, have harnessed the energies of all sectors of their society to fight the epidemic and prevent it from destroying their countries. 
Here are some of the lessons we must learn from their experience: 
* Unless we take the necessary precautions any one of us may contract HIV. Understanding HIV and being careful and sensible about our sexual behaviour can prevent us becoming infected, and infecting others. 
* We must treat the epidemic as a national emergency and engage all organs of society in the struggle against it. 
* We must speak openly about HIV/AIDS, attacking ignorance and prejudice and wrong ideas about the disease. 
* We must enable infected and sick people to live with dignity and contribute to their communities for as long as they are able. 
* We must find ways to care for the sick and the helpless within the community, especially when the family unit has become overburdened or has disintegrated. 
Educators can and must help curb the disease and deal with its effects 
* Educators must set an example of responsible sexual behaviour. In so doing, they will protect their families, colleagues, learners and themselves. 
* Because educators are well educated, they can grasp the facts about HIV/AIDS and help spread correct information about the disease and its effects. 
* Almost every young person attends school, so educators have a great opportunity to discuss the disease, and help the young to protect themselves from becoming infected, getting sick and dying. 
* Educators are in frequent touch with parents, and can therefore spread the message about HIV/AIDS deeply into the community. 
* Educators can help create an environment in the workplace where people can be open about their HIV status without fear of prejudice or discrimination. 
* Educators can find creative ways to support their ill colleagues and learners, and make the school a centre of hope and care in the community. 
Male educators have a special responsibility 
There must be an end to the practice of male teachers demanding sex with schoolgirls or female teachers. It shows selfish disrespect for the rights and dignity of women and young girls. 
Having sex with learners betrays the trust of the community. It is also against the law. It is a disciplinary offense. Tragically, nowadays, it is spreading HIV/AIDS and bringing misery and grief to these precious young people and their families. 
Conclusion 
This booklet will help equip you to play your part in the struggle against HIV and secure a shining future for this and the next generation. Please read it and talk about it at home, with your colleagues at school, in your governing bodies, with your learners, in your places of worship, in your sports clubs, and wherever you socialise. If you need to change your own sexual behaviour, please have the courage and good sense to do so. 
Your life is at stake. So are the lives of the members of your families, your colleagues and your learners. For their sake and the sake of the nation, please read this booklet and act on it. 
With my very best wishes. 
Yours sincerely 
Professor Kader Asmal, MP 
Minister of Education 
1. HIV AND AIDS: FACTS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS 
What is HIV? 
* HIV is a very small germ or organism, called a virus, which people become infected with. It cannot be seen with the naked eye, but only under a microscope. 
* HIV only survives and multiplies in body fluids such as sperm, vaginal fluids, breast milk, blood and saliva. We can only become infected through contact with infected body fluids. 
* The body's natural ability to fight illness is called the immune system. It is the body's defence against infection. 
* HIV attacks the immune system and reduces the body's resistance to all kinds of illness, including flu, diarrhoea, pneumonia, TB and certain cancers. 
* That is why HIV is called the Human Immunodeficiency Virus. 
* HIV eventually makes the body so weak that it cannot fight sickness and so causes death. 
* Usually people die between five and ten years after becoming infected, but some HIV-infected people live longer. 
What is AIDS? 
* AIDS is the final stage of infection with HIV, and this is what causes a person to die. 
* People with AIDS usually have several different illnesses at the same time. These differ among different people. 
* The word syndrome means that several symptoms occur at the same time. It is used to emphasise that people with AIDS have many signs and symptoms, because they suffer from several illnesses at once. AIDS is not actually one disease. 
* AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. 
How is HIV spread? 
* HIV is an infectious disease, but there are only certain situations in which people who have the virus can pass it to other people. 
* Sexual intercourse is the most common way through which people become infected, because the virus survives in sperm and vaginal fluids. 
* Babies born to mothers with HIV can also become infected just before and during birth, or during breast feeding. 
* Infected blood can spread the virus, for example if it splashes on broken skin, or by friends or family members sharing blades, razors or toothbrushes. 
* Drug addicts who share needles can infect each other. 
* Although blood used in transfusions is treated against the virus, errors sometimes happen and occasionally blood transfusions may be a cause of infection. 
What does NOT spread the virus? 
* You cannot be infected with HIV by sharing a house, desk, chair, office, car, taxi, locker, telephone, cup, fork, plate, mug, toilet, towel, sheets or clothes with someone who is infected. 
* You cannot be infected with HIV by sharing food, sharing a bath, sharing a swimming pool, or shaking hands with someone who is infected. 
* If you hug or kiss someone with HIV on the lips you cannot get infected. 
* You cannot be infected with HIV by being bitten by a mosquito, bed bug, tick or flea that has bitten a person with HIV. 
* You cannot be infected with HIV in the course of any normal educational activities which take place in a learning environment. 
What are the symptoms of HIV? 
* Most people with HIV have no symptoms for a long time. They look and feel just like you and me. 
* Most people with HIV feel well and remain productive in their families and workplaces for between five and eight years after infection with HIV. 
* But some people start showing symptoms quite soon after they are infected. 
* When people with HIV start showing symptoms, it means the disease has progressed to AIDS. 
So what do people with HIV/AIDS die from? 
* People with HIV/AIDS often die of illnesses such as TB or pneumonia, to which they have become more vulnerable because of the virus in their bodies. 
* People who do not have HIV also get these illnesses, but because of HIV the number of TB and pneumonia cases has greatly increased. 
* These days, because of HIV infection, TB and pneumonia are causing many deaths among young people.
* Three quarters of people with TB now also have HIV. 
* People may also die from very severe diarrhoea and from certain types of cancer, especially blood cancers called lymphomas and a skin cancer called Kaposi's Sarcoma. 
* Some illnesses, particularly acute pneumonia, can be very quick and sometimes people can die before having the HIV infection confirmed. 
How can we tell if someone has HIV? 
* The only certain way to tell if someone has HIV is through a blood test. If the test shows we have the virus, we are called 'HIV positive'. 
* But, for several weeks or months after a person is infected, the body does not show signs of the infection. This is called the 'window period'. If we take the test for HIV during the window period, the result will be negative, even if we are infected. The health authorities do not recommend routine HIV testing, because a negative result does not always mean an absence of infection. 
* We can only be certain about our HIV status if we have the test six months after the last occasion that we could have been exposed to the virus, for example through unsafe sex. 
* Most people who are sexually active do not know whether they are infected with HIV or not. We must behave as though we could become infected, or infect others, and so protect ourselves and others from harm. 
What is an HIV test? 
* A small amount of blood is taken from your arm with a needle and syringe, or by pricking your finger and putting the blood on blotting paper. The blood sample is then scientifically examined. 
* The test does not show the virus itself, but it shows the presence of 'antibodies' in the blood. Antibodies indicate that the body is reacting to the presence of the HIV virus, and trying to defend the body against it. These antibodies only appear in the blood between three and six months after the infection. 
* Before you have an HIV test you should speak with a counsellor about the test and what you will do when you hear the result. 
* The result of the test usually takes two weeks, but sometimes it is available much sooner, even the same day. The result is private (confidential). You do not have a legal obligation to tell anyone if you are HIV negative or HIV positive. 
* But, it is right and necessary to share this information with anyone you have had sex with. And it is best to tell a close family member or friend who can support you. 
Can a person pass on the infection when he or she is not sick? 
* Yes, a person can pass on the HIV infection to others at any time after he or she has become infected. This often happens before people realise they have HIV infection and even before an HIV test would show them to be 'positive'. 
Isn't it best, all the same, to keep away from a person with HIV? 
* No. HIV cannot be transmitted by casual contact. So there is no reason why a person should fear being infected by normal daily interactions with someone who has HIV. 
* Many famous sportsmen and women, film actors, directors, academics and politicians have all worked effectively for a long time when they had HIV until they became ill. Many citizens who are not famous have done the same. 
* It is cruel and unnecessary to add to people's suffering. It is hard enough facing premature death without being shunned by family, colleagues and friends. 
* If we reject people who have HIV, they may be forced to try to hide it or pretend they do not have it. In doing so they put other people at risk. People who are infected must be encouraged to take the necessary precautions against passing on the infection, such as wearing condoms during sex or not breast-feeding their babies. 
* Any of us could get the virus, especially if we are sexually active and act carelessly. We should not treat other people in ways we would not want to be treated ourselves. 
Is there a cure for HIV or AIDS? 
* There is no cure for HIV or AIDS. 
* Medical researchers in many countries, including South Africa, are working urgently to develop vaccines to prevent HIV infection. But even when a vaccine is developed, it will take several years before it can be thoroughly tested, approved by the proper authorities, and made available on a large scale to the public. 
* Medicines that delay the onset of AIDS-related illnesses can be given to people with HIV but these are not cures. Unfortunately they are very expensive. Drug companies are developing cheaper alternatives, but these are not yet generally available. 
* When HIV weakens our immune systems, our bodies are unable to withstand infections like TB and pneumonia. TB can be cured provided the patient takes the right drugs for the right period of time. HIV positive people can take medication to prevent pneumonia. In such ways, people with HIV can be helped to live longer and fuller lives. HIV and AIDS can be prevented 
* Prevention is the only sure way to defeat HIV and AIDS. 
* We can avoid becoming infected and infecting others by ensuring that we act carefully, considerately and responsibly at all times, especially in our sexual behaviour. 
* The tragedy in our country is that so many people are dying from a disease which is entirely preventable. 
Why don't we hear of many people dying from HIV/AIDS in our community? 
* Because of the time lapse between infection and death, some areas of the country are only now beginning to experience substantial numbers of adult deaths due to HIV. 
* We may not know what is really going on around us. 
* Because HIV-infected people often die of familiar diseases, like TB or pneumonia, people may not be sure whether a fatal illness was AIDS-related. Often family members may not know or may be unwilling to admit the truth. 
* There is a lot of secrecy surrounding HIV/AIDS. Many people are ashamed or frightened to be HIV positive. They and their families will not talk about it. 
* Because of ignorance and fear, people with HIV/AIDS have faced discrimination in their communities, and some have been killed. Such actions have scared people and prevented them from disclosing their HIV infection. 
* Some people still deny that there is such a disease. Some claim that it is a plot against black people. In fact, HIV/AIDS is a world-wide epidemic that affects people of every race. 
How do we know this HIV epidemic isn't exaggerated? 
* Research has shown that certain social conditions make it more likely that high rates of HIV infection and death from HIV/AIDS will occur. These include poverty, malnutrition, poor sanitation and hygiene, violence, including violent and abusive behaviour against women and girls, subordination of women, high youth unemployment, migrant labour and breakdown of family life, sexual promiscuity especially by men, sexual activity among teenagers, and high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). All these factors are present in South Africa. 
* For several years the Department of Health has been undertaking anonymous testing of blood taken from pregnant women throughout the country. In 1998 these tests showed that 21% of pregnant teenagers, 26% of pregnant women aged 20-24, and 27% of women aged 25-29 were HIV positive. Since HIV is mostly spread through sex, it is highly likely that the male sexual partners of these women also have HIV. 
* Research undertaken in large South African companies shows high rates of infection among their workers, in all grades. 
* Having examined the available data, the United Nations AIDS programme (UN AIDS) estimates that one of every eight adults in South Africa now has HIV. 
* Research has shown that there is now a problem with HIV/AIDS in every community in the country. 
* Even without research, most of us know that the disease is claiming many lives, young and old. Many of us have lost family members and neighbours. Many of us are caring for sick relatives. Many of us know that we have HIV ourselves. 
Living with hope 
* Most people with HIV are well and will continue to feel well for some years after they have become infected. 
* During this period, adults and children with HIV can live active and productive lives at school, work and home. 
* People with HIV need support and advice. People who test HIV positive must be counselled to look forward to several years of normal life. 
* The community around us and especially the school environment can be a source of love, care and support. 
* The challenge for us as educators, with or without HIV, is to enable the school to realise this potential.
2. EIGHT KEY MESSAGES ABOUT PREVENTING HIV 
Educators have a unique opportunity to change the course of the epidemic 
* Since almost every child in the country attends school, educators have a unique opportunity to influence children's ideas about sex and relationships, even before these start.
* By so doing educators can play a central role in changing the course of the HIV epidemic. 
* With few exceptions, children starting their school careers do not have HIV infection. 
* By the time they leave school, many children have acquired the virus. Many will become infected after leaving school, unless they have been helped to adopt safe sexual behaviour. 
Leadership begins at home 
* Educators are expected to be role models and leaders in the community. By adopting safe and responsible sexual practices ourselves, we can protect ourselves from HIV and help countless others to do the same. 
* Here are eight key messages about preventing HIV. 
1) Have safer sex 
* The majority of HIV infections occur during sex. To prevent HIV we must adopt safer sexual practices. There is no other way! 
* The safest sexual practice is to abstain from intercourse until marriage, and then to stay faithful to your partner. 
* If you have intercourse, assume that you and your partner may carry the HIV infection. Use a male or female condom. 
* Have one sexual partner, and practice safe sex each time. 
* When it is time to have children, both partners should have HIV tests and get the results before stopping the use of condoms and trying to conceive. 
2) Love and trust 
* The man or woman who really loves you is the one who takes precautions to make sure you will not catch HIV from him or her by wearing a condom. 
* Having a partner you trust now is not enough to protect you from HIV. Your partner, or you yourself, may have become infected during a previous sexual relationship, even one that ended some time ago. 
3) Saying 'Yes', saying 'No' 
* A man must ask a woman's permission before having sex with her. 
* Any man who forces a woman to have sex when she has said 'No' is a rapist. 
* Rape is a very serious crime. The victim must be taken immediately to a district surgeon, or medical facility for examination, counselling and emergency contraception. The rape must be reported to the police, and the victim will be asked to make a statement. The police must provide support and counselling for the victim, and investigate every reported case. 
4) Avoiding child abuse: run and tell! 
* Teachers have a special responsibility to respect and protect the children in their care. Abuse of a child by a teacher is particularly horrible, because it betrays a trust given to teachers by the child's parents. 
* It is untrue that if a man has sex with a virgin, especially a little girl, it will cure HIV. There is no cure for HIV. Instead, sex with a girl or boy child will cause that child untold pain and misery, and may infect them with the HIV virus and cut off their life. 
* Children are taught to respect older people, but that does not mean that they must do everything older people tell them to do, especially if it is wrong and makes the child feel uncomfortable. 
* Every child understands that there are nice kinds of physical touching, like a mother's caress or hug, or holding hands with a friend. There are other kinds of touching that make them feel uncomfortable. 
* A child should never stay in a situation where they feel uncomfortable. They must be taught to shout for help, run away and ask an adult they trust for help. 
* Children must be taught never to go to the home of a stranger, or walk in the street or the fields with a stranger, or get in the car of a stranger. 
* They should not do any of these things with someone who makes them feel uncomfortable or is behaving strangely, even if that person is a relative or well known to them. 
5) You don't have to have lots of boyfriends or girlfriends to get HIV 
* People who have sex with many people are more likely to catch HIV, but HIV does not only affect people who have many partners. 
* If only one partner was infected and did not use condoms, we could get infected. 
* Many people have caught the virus after having sex just once with a person who was infected with HIV, and did not use a condom. 
* People who are faithful to their wives or husbands can catch the virus if their spouse is not faithful to them. 
* Each year, many children and women are infected with HIV when they are raped. 
* Some children acquired HIV from their mothers. Some of these children have lived long enough to attend school. * People also become infected through contact with infected blood, such as from contaminated needles, shared razors or blades. 
6) Using a condom will also protect you from STDs, infertility and unwanted pregnancy 
* Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) cause a sore on the penis or vulva, or pus or pain when urinating. Untreated sexually transmitted diseases increase your chance of getting HIV. Do not have sex if you have an STD. Get treated! 
* Condoms protect you against other sexually transmitted diseases as well as HIV. 
* Sexually transmitted diseases are the most common cause of infertility. 
* By using a condom you can avoid HIV and other STDs, and you can decide when you want to conceive a child. 
7) Condoms can be fun 
* Many people say that using a condom is like eating a sweet with its wrapper on. Do these 'experts' really know how to use them? 
* Slipping the condom on can become an exciting part of sexual play. 
* Using a condom is a skill like any other. The more often you do it, the better you get. 
* The best sex is when you don't have to worry about catching a deadly disease. 
8) Drugs and alcohol 
* Drugs and alcohol use are also linked to many cases of HIV. 
* Drunk people often forget about using condoms. Men often take advantage of drunk women to get sex, with or without using a condom. The same can happen with drugs. 
* Some addictive drugs like heroin are taken by injection. Many people have caught HIV from sharing injection needles and syringes. 
* Never share a syringe and needle with another person. 
3. QUESTIONS EDUCATORS ASK ABOUT SEXUALITY EDUCATION 
Talking about sex? It's against our culture! 
* We all have sex, but many of us have been taught to think of it as immoral, dirty or embarrassing, unless it is practiced within the bonds of marriage. 
* We are not used to talking openly about sex, hearing about sex or speaking words like penis or vagina or intercourse. 
* We are not used to talking with children about sexual matters. 
* These aspects of our culture, that have made us shy about sex, were developed in different times. We now have a completely new challenge with HIV. It is a new disease that was not there when our old customs were created. 
* The arrival of HIV means we have to make some changes to our culture because if we do not make these changes very large numbers of our young people will die and we may do so as well. 
* Changing the rules about discussing sex does not mean that our culture will be threatened. There is much more to our culture than codes and practices relating to sex. 
* In fact, culture changes all the time. That is how it survives. Think how many customs have changed in our lifetimes and our parents' and grandparents' lifetimes. 
* If we don't control HIV/AIDS, it will destroy our society and our cultures will be history. 
* We need to adapt our customary attitude toward sex and talking about sex, because the lives of our spouses and partners, our children, and those in our care, depend upon it. 
* It shows maturity to talk about sexuality in a straightforward and responsible way. Young people will appreciate our concern for their problems. I won't encourage immorality! 
* Parents have the first responsibility for teaching children what is right and what is wrong, what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. 
* As educators, we have a very strong moral responsibility to help protect the health and lives of children we educate, and give the best possible advice to parents and learners alike. 
* Some of our religious beliefs about sexual morality may make it difficult for us to discuss sex with children, but we cannot expose young people in our care to life-threatening situations when we have information that could save them. 
* It is not true that teaching young people about sex and sexuality makes them promiscuous or immoral. In our society, and many other countries, young people are starting to have sex very early whether we like it or not. Sexuality education, that gives knowledge and teaches respect for themselves and others, will help them to make wiser decisions about whether or how to have sex, and keep safe. 
* The threat of HIV does not mean that we have to discard our moral code. A strong and clear moral code was never more necessary. But it should include the obligation to practice sexual self-restraint and respect for the rights of others, especially our sexual partners. It should include the obligation to teach young people the importance of doing the same. 
* A good starting point is to recognise that sexuality enhances life if it is properly directed. Good sexual relationships are not about power. They are not about demanding rights. They are about mutual enjoyment and respect. Teaching in a country where human rights are protected 
* In South Africa human rights are protected and guaranteed by the Constitution. 
* Human rights belong to all people, learners as well as educators. 
* Rights come with responsibilities. For us all to enjoy our human rights we must all exercise our responsibilities. 
* The Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of access to information and freedom of conscience, thought, religion, belief and opinion. The Constitution gives special protection to children's rights. It puts a duty on everyone to act always in the best interests of a child. 
* Children have the right to information about sexual health and HIV prevention. 
* We may discourage learners from having sex, but learners must be given accurate information on safer sex as they will make their own decisions. 
* This is their constitutional right and our constitutional responsibility as educators. Shouldn't we just tell young people not to have sex? 
* It is good to talk to young men and women about not having sex. We must also remember that many of them will ignore or not be able to follow this advice. 
* It is easy to forget how important boyfriends and girlfriends were to us when we were teenagers. These relationships are just as important for young people now. They are a source of development and growth, even when they involve difficult choices. 
* Research shows that if we give young people proper information about sex, about the risks associated with sexual activity, and how they can protect themselves, then they are more likely to decide for themselves to delay the start of sexual activity. If they have knowledge, and have discussed these questions openly and without fear, they are more likely to practice sex safely when they do begin a sexual relationship. 
* Whenever we consider the question of life skills and sexuality education, let us remember that tens of thousands of our young people have already begun sexual activity and become infected by the HIV virus out of ignorance. Many young people believe that they are safe because they are young. They may think it is macho to take risks. Taking risks with HIV is not manly or cool, it is stupid, and it involves extreme danger to others. 
* Some young men who know or suspect that they are infected, have made the cruel decision to infect others, by jack rolling or gang rape. 
* We must face up to what is happening in our society. Just telling young people not to have sex is not the answer, or at best it is only a part of the answer. The HIV/AIDS epidemic shows us that we are dealing with a moral crisis in human relations in our country. We must teach our children and our young people to respect themselves, to respect their fellows, to show special understanding for the rights of girls and women, to join together in human solidarity to save ourselves and each other. That should be the basis of our morality. 
* Discussion among young people themselves, facilitated by a knowledgeable young person, perhaps someone who is living with HIV, is a very effective form of education about the disease. NGOs doing this type of work should be welcomed in our schools and encouraged to help. Aren't the children too young for this sort of information? 
* From the time they first start school, learners need to have information about HIV/AIDS presented to them in a way which is appropriate to their age, in the context of life skills education. 
* Learning programmes have been and are being developed for life skills education for all ages, and training is being provided to enable educators to do this. 
* We often forget that most children become aware of sex and want to know about it at a very young age. It is a difficult fact that many children are already sexually active by the age of 12. 
* Many children become aware of HIV/AIDS when they are quite young, since they know people, including parents or siblings, who are ill or have died. The media is full of stories about the epidemic. Children spread information about the epidemic among themselves, whether or not it is accurate or true. The best thing is for educators to be prepared to start providing the correct information about sex and sexuality and HIV/AIDS before children learn incorrect information about these things from their peers. 
4. PREVENTING DISEASE TRANSMISSION IN SCHOOLS 
If our schools have staff and learners with HIV won't the rest of us catch it? 
* Since HIV is spread mostly through sex and contact with blood, most of us are not at risk of catching HIV in the course of our normal teaching or learning activities. 
* There are no known cases of HIV transmission in schools or institutions during educational activities. But what if there are accidents and injuries in fights? 
* There is a possible risk of HIV transmission through contact with infected blood. 
* This risk is negligible if good basic first aid is applied. 
* The golden rule here is to apply universal precautions. What are universal precautions? 
* Universal precautions are called this because they are applied to every person and every body fluid. 
* Universal precautions are necessary because in a learning environment it is not possible to know who has HIV. 
* Because of the long period between HIV infection and the start of illness, most of the people with HIV in a school will not know that they are infected. 
* Because of the 'window period' during which the signs of infection do not show up in a test, even a negative HIV test does not mean that a person does not have HIV. 
* HIV is not the only danger. Other potentially fatal diseases that are quite common in South Africa, particularly hepatitis B, can be caught from infected body fluids. 
* If we apply the same precautions to every situation where there is blood, we will be safe from HIV and other diseases carried in the blood. What does every school need for first aid? 
* Two first-aid kits that are kept well stocked (see box). 
* A bottle of household bleach. 
* A stock of plastic shopping bags checked for holes. 
* A container for pouring water. 
* If your school has no running water, a 25 litre drum of clean water should be kept at all times for use in emergencies. 
CONTENTS OF FIRST-AID KITS 
* Four pairs of latex gloves (two medium, two large) 
* Four pairs of rubber household gloves (two medium, two large) 
* Materials to cover wounds, cuts or grazes (e.g. lint or gauze), waterproof plasters, disinfectant (e.g. household bleach), scissors, cotton wool, tape for securing dressings, tissues 
* A mouth piece, for mouth to mouth resuscitation 
How should we manage accidents and injuries at school? 
1) No one should have direct contact with another person's blood or body fluids 
* Every first aid kit should contain rubber gloves and these should be worn at all times when attending a person who is bleeding from injury or a nosebleed. 
* Anyone who cleans blood from a surface or floor or from cloths should also wear gloves. 
* The same precautions should be taken with other body fluids, including vomit, faeces, pus and urine, although it is very unlikely that a person would catch HIV from these. 
* If there are no gloves available, plastic shopping bags can be put on your hands, so long as they have no holes and care is taken not to get blood or cleaning water on the inside. 
* All learners should be taught not to touch blood and wounds but to ask for help from a member of staff if there is an injury or nosebleed. 
2) Stop the bleeding as quickly as possible 
* If a colleague or learner is bleeding, the first action must be to try to stop the bleeding by applying pressure directly over the area with the nearest available cloth or towel. 
* Unless the injured person is unconscious or very severely injured, they should be helped to do this themselves. 
* If someone has a nosebleed he or she should be shown how to apply pressure to the bridge of his or her nose himself or herself. 
3) Cleaning wounds 
* Once the bleeding has been stopped, injured people should be helped to wash their grazes or wounds in clean water with antiseptic, if it is available. If not, use household bleach diluted in water (1 part bleach, 9 parts water). 
* Wounds must then be covered with a waterproof dressing or plaster. 
* Learners and educators must learn to keep all wounds, sores, grazes or lesions (where the skin is split) covered at all times. 
4) Managing accidental exposure to another person's blood, or exposure during injury 
* Skin that becomes exposed to blood must be cleaned promptly. 
* Cleaning should be done with running water. If this is not available, clean water from a container should be poured over the area to be cleaned. 
* If an antiseptic is available, the area should be cleaned with antiseptic. If not, use household bleach diluted in water (1 part bleach, 9 parts water). 
* If blood has splashed on the face, particularly eyes or the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, these should be flushed with running water for three minutes. 
5) Cleaning contaminated surfaces and materials 
* Contaminated surfaces or floors must be cleaned with bleach and water (1 part bleach, 9 parts water). * Bandages and cloths that become bloody should be sealed in a plastic bag and incinerated (burnt to ashes) or sent to an appropriate disposal firm. 
* Any contaminated instruments or equipment should be washed, soaked in bleach for an hour and dried. * Ensure that bathrooms and toilets are clean, hygienic and free from blood spills. 
6) Disposing of sanitary towels and tampons 
* Every school must ensure that there are arrangements for the disposal of sanitary towels and tampons. All female staff and learners must know of these arrangements so that no other person has contact with these items. 
What about very serious incidents, such as rape or stabbing when there is a known HIV risk? 
* The risk of HIV transmission is much higher in cases of rape, or stabbing with a needle or blade, especially if more than one person is involved. 
* A woman who is raped should be given immediate support and comfort in her distress. She should be asked not to bathe or change her clothes (because evidence of the rape must be kept for the medical and police investigation). She must be taken at once to a district surgeon or medical facility for examination and emergency contraception, and to a police station so that she can make a statement and lay a charge. Arrangements must be made for her to be given professional counselling and help. 
* With a stabbing or exposure of broken skin to HIV infected blood, give first aid immediately. A stabbing should then be reported to the police. 
* In all these situations the people should be taken to an appropriate me-dical facility for counselling about their risk of contracting HIV, and their parents or guardians should be contacted urgently. 
* Drug treatment is available in the private sector that may reduce the risk of a person who does not have HIV from contracting the infection if raped or stabbed. The effectiveness of drugs in these circumstances is not proven. They are not available from public hospitals. Anyone who has a significant risk of contracting HIV and has the money for these drugs may choose to use them. Decisions about the use of these drugs must be taken quickly as it is considered that they are most effective the sooner they are taken after the exposure. 
How can we prevent HIV transmission during sport? 
* The only possible risk of HIV transmission is during contact sports where injuries can occur. Even here the risk is extremely small if the following rules are applied. 
* First-aid kits with rubber gloves should be available during every sports session or match. 
* No one should play a sport with uncovered wounds or flesh injuries. 
* If a graze or injury occurs during play the injured player should be called off the field, given first aid and only allowed back with their injury clean and covered. 
* Blood-stained clothes should be changed. 
* Educators and learners with HIV are advised first to discuss with a doctor any possible risks to their health and of transmission during the sport. 
Sexual relations in schools 
* In schools with hostels it is likely that some learners will have sexual relations on the premises, whether it is against the rules or not. 
* Advice and counselling, including peer group discussions, are especially important in these situations. 
* Condoms should be freely available to learners who are sexually active. Learners should be advised why and how they should be used and disposed of. 
Sexual relations between educators and learners are illegal 
* Educators must not have sexual relations with learners. It is against the law, even if the learner consents. Such action transgresses the code of conduct for educators, who are in a position of trust. 
* Strict disciplinary action will be taken against any educator who has sex with a learner. 
* Sex that is demanded by an educator without consent is rape, which is a serious crime, and the educator will be charged. If an educator has sex with a girl or boy who is under 16 years, he or she will be charged with statutory rape and may face a penalty of life imprisonment. 
* If you are aware of a colleague who is having sexual relations with a learner you must report them to the principal or higher educational authorities, and if the boy or girl is under 16, to the police. If you do not do so you may be charged with being an accessory to a rape. 
What about other diseases? Can't we catch these from people with HIV? 
* Because their immune systems are damaged, most people with HIV are in greater danger of catching your illnesses than you are of catching theirs. 
* The exception is TB. Anyone who may have TB should be advised to seek immediate medical treatment and return to the school or institution only after advice from their doctor. 
Are there any other situations when people with HIV would be excluded from school? 
* If a person with HIV develops uncontrollable bleeding or has unmanageable wounds it might be necessary to exclude him or her until these problems are brought under control. 
* If a person displays physically or sexually aggressive behaviour, it will be necessary to take appropriate action in accordance with medical advice, the applicable code of conduct for learners, respect for the rights of all concerned, and the law. 
5. BUILDING AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT AND A CULTURE OF NON-DISCRIMINATION 
HIV/AIDS will touch all of us 
* Even if we avoid catching HIV, very few of us will be untouched by it. 
* Most of us will lose family members and friends to HIV. 
* We will all have more funerals to attend and need our colleagues to understand if we are placed under additional strain or have to take time off due to bereavement. 
* Those of us who get HIV will find eventually that we become ill and need lengthy periods of sick leave. Our colleagues who are well will have to understand this and cover our teaching duties. 
* Increasingly we will find we have learners with HIV/AIDS in our classes and they will need special help when they become ill. Their attendance at school will be affected, and they are likely to lose concentration and fall behind in their work. Special consideration must be given to them, including the chance to do school work at home. Wherever possible, home vi-sits should be arranged by the school. 
Living with HIV/AIDS 
* Educators and learners with HIV should be able to lead as full a life as possible. 
* They should not be denied the opportunity to receive education or work as educators for as long as they are able to do so. 
* Since their HIV infection does not pose a significant risk to others in schools or institutions so long as the necessary precautions are followed, there is no reason to deny infected educators and learners the same rights as others. 
Dealing with prejudice 
* Any special measures taken in respect of a learner or educator with HIV should be fair and justifiable in the light of medical facts, school or institution conditions, and in the best interest of the person with HIV and those of others. 
* Educators need to be vigilant about the possibility of discrimination in schools, take swift action to defuse any situations that occur, and deal effectively with perpetrators. 
* Prejudice thrives on fear and ignorance. The most effective way to reduce such threats is by sharing the information contained in this document with learners so that they understand the medical facts about HIV and how it is transmitted and know how they can protect themselves. 
Refusal to study with a person with HIV/AIDS, or refusal to teach or be taught by such a person 
* Learners or educators who refuse to study with, teach or be taught by a person with HIV/AIDS should by counselled. 
* The situation should be resolved by the principal, educators, and if necessary, school governing body or council of the institution in accordance with the National Policy on HIV/AIDS of the Ministry of Education. 
Orphans 
* Many learners will become orphaned or lose close family members and will need emotional help and guidance from educators. 
* Orphaned learners may face financial hardship and have difficulties with school fees, uniforms and books. 
* Some orphans may in fact be left to look after younger siblings. They may have to act as the head of their households, however young and in need of help they may be. 
* They may themselves be infected, or be caring for others who are infected and ill. 
* Educators need to be aware that learners orphaned due to AIDS may face pre-judice and be neglected by people who are supposed to look after them. 
* Schools will need to develop policies to guide the actions of educators who suspect such neglect, as they do when other forms of child abuse are suspected. 
Testing for HIV in schools and disclosure of HIV status 
* The law does not allow learners or educators (or any employee) to be forced to have HIV tests. 
* Genuinely voluntary disclosure of a learner's or educator's HIV status should be welcomed. 
* Educators who are given such information must be prepared to treat it as confidential and ensure that no unfair discrimination follows from it. 
* Information on a learner's HIV status can only be disclosed by an educator to another person with the written permission of the learner (if over 14 years) or his or her parents. 
A school policy on HIV/AIDS 
* Schools or institutions should develop their own policy on HIV/AIDS, in order to give operational effect to these national guidelines. Such a policy must be consistent with the Constitution and the law. A school policy must not contradict national policy, or the guidelines in this booklet. 
* The school has a responsibility to be a centre of information and support on HIV/AIDS in the community it serves. Major role players from the broader community, for example religious and traditional leaders, local health workers or traditional healers, should be invited to participate in developing the school's policy. 
* If the resources are available, a school may want to establish a Health Advisory Committee. This would be a committee of the governing body. Its membership should include staff, parents, learners and health professionals. Someone with health knowledge should chair the Committee. The Committee should advise the governing body on the implementation of these guidelines. It should help develop the schoolÕs HIV policy and monitor its implementation, especially HIV prevention. 
* The school policy should be reviewed as new scientific information becomes available, including advice from the national or provincial health or education authorities. 
Reducing the risk of transmitting illness to people with HIV/AIDS 
* Illnesses that may be relatively unimportant for a well person can be serious for other people and life threatening if caught by a person with AIDS. 
* Learners and educators with infectious diseases including measles, mumps, German measles, chicken pox and whooping cough should consult a doctor and stay away from school until they are better. 
* Schools should inform parents of this policy and strongly recommend that all children are fully vaccinated. 
Supporting sick learners 
* Learners and students are expected to attend classes in accordance with legal requirements for as long as they are able to function effectively and pose no medically significant risk to others in the school or institution. 
* Every school with sufficient facilities should have an area where learners and educators who are feeling unwell can lie down during the day for short periods. This will enable learners who are sick to stay in school for longer. 
* If and when they become ill or pose a medically significant risk to others they should be allowed to study at home and academic work should be made available for this. Where possible, parents should be allowed to educate them at home. 
* Some learners with HIV/AIDS may develop behavioural problems or suffer neurological damage. Such learners should be assessed and, where it is possible and appropriate, placed in specialised residential institutions for learners with special education needs. 
* Some extra-curricular activities can be very stressful for learners with HIV. Educators need to be sensitive to this and excuse such learners from participation when necessary. 
* Medicines often have to be taken at set times in order to be properly effective. Educators need to be aware of this and allow learners with HIV to slip out of class to take medication when necessary. 
* Schools should help learners with HIV to form a support group or link with one in the community. 
Supporting sick colleagues 
* Educators and other staff who develop AIDS-related illnesses need understanding from their colleagues. 
* Increasingly they will need days off work or become exhausted during the day and need to lie down for some time. 
* During these times, other members of staff will have to cover for them, and this will have an impact on their own work and well-being. 
* The scale of the HIV epidemic is so great in the country that, until we all practice safer sex, these things will form part of a new reality with which we have to live. 
* Educators often feel overburdened already and find it hard to see how they could do more work. Such feelings are very understandable. This emergency makes exceptional demands on all South Africans. Perhaps we should remember that one day our well colleagues might have to cover for us, unless we protect ourselves from infection. 
'The most important part of our work is to educate people to accept, love and support those with HIV, so that we do not have to hide away or be silent. The more we hide away, the more pressure we feel, the sicker we get and the faster we die' - Valencia Mofokeng, HIV positive widowed mother and leader of the Orange Farm Anti-Aids Club's support group for people living with HIV/AIDS, in Reconstruct, 7 November 1999 
6. DECLARATION OF PARTNERSHIP AGAINST AIDS 
by President Thabo Mbeki 
Declaration 
'HIV/AIDS is among us. It is real. It is spreading. We can only win against HIV/AIDS if we join hands to save our nation. 
'For too long we have closed our eyes as a nation. For many years, we have allowed the virus to spread, and at a rate in our country which is one of the fastest in the world. Every single day a further 1 500 people in South Africa get infected. To date, more than 3 million people have been infected. 
The danger is real 
'Many more face the danger of being affected by HIV/AIDS. Because it is carried and communicated by other human beings, it is with us in our workplaces, in our classrooms and our lecture halls. It is there in our church gatherings and other religious functions. HIV/AIDS walks with us. It travels with us wherever we go. It is there when we play sport. It is there when we sing and dance. 
'Many of us have grieved for orphans left with no one to fend for them. We have experienced AIDS in the groans of wasting lives. We have carried it in small and large coffins to many graveyards. At times, we did not know that we were burying people who had died from AIDS. At other times we knew, but chose to remain silent. 
'And when the time comes for each of us to make a personal precautionary decision, we fall prey to doubt and false confidence. We hope that HIV/AIDS is someone else's problem. 
Changing our way of life 
'HIV/AIDS is not someone else's problem. It is my problem. It is your problem. By allowing it to spread, we face the danger that half of our youth will not reach adulthood. Their education will be wasted. The economy will shrink. There will be a large number of sick people whom the healthy will not be able to maintain. Our dreams as a people will be shattered. 
'HIV spreads mainly through sex. You have the right to live your life the way you want to. But I appeal to the young people, who represent our country's future, to abstain from sex for as long as possible. If you decide to engage in sex, use a condom. In the same way, I appeal to men and women to be faithful to each other, but otherwise to use condoms. 
Partnership 
'The power to defeat the spread of HIV and AIDS lies in our Partnership: as youth, as women and men, as business people, as workers, as religious people, as parents and teachers, as farmers and farm workers, as the unemployed and the professionals, as the rich and the poor - in fact, all of us. 
'Today, we join hands in this Partnership Against HIV/AIDS, together we pledge to spread the message!
'Every day, every night - wherever we are - we shall let our families, friends and peers know that they can save themselves and save the nation, by changing the way we live - and how we love. We shall use every opportunity openly to discuss the issue of HIV/AIDS. As Partners Against AIDS, together we pledge to care! 
'We shall work together to care for those living with HIV/AIDS and for the children orphaned through AIDS. They must not be subjected to discrimination of any kind. They can live productive lives for many years. They are human beings like you and me. 
'When we lend a hand, we build our own humanity, and when we remind ourselves that, like them, every one of us can become infected. 
'As Partners Against AIDS, together we pledge to pool our resources and to commit our brain power! 
'There is still no cure for HIV and AIDS. Nothing can prevent infection except our own behaviour. We shall work together to support medical institutions to search for a vaccine and a cure. We shall mobilise all possible resources to spread the message of prevention, to offer support for those infected and affected, to de-stigmatise HIV and AIDS and to conti-nue our search for a medical solution. 
'And so today we join hands in the Partnership, fully aware that our unity is our strength. The simple but practical action that we take today is tomorrow's insurance for our nation. 
'Accordingly, we pledge that wherever we meet and study, work and sing, play and enjoy one another's company, we will protect ourselves and our partners against HIV and AIDS. Together, as Partners against HIV/AIDS, we can and shall win. 
'...There is no other moment but the present, to take action. I thank you for your attention and urge you to ACT NOW!'

The policy on basic
household sanitation
made easy
The policy on basic
household sanitation
made easy
What is sanitation and why does it matter?
There are 18 million South Africans (in 3 million households) who do not have access to basic sanitation at present. An
estimated 15% of clinics and 11,7% of schools are without sanitation. Many other schools use pit latrines that are inadequate,
dirty and unsafe. This all adds up to a potential health time bomb. The government will therefore support communities and
households in wiping out the sanitation backlog by 2010.
What does 'sanitation' mean?
Sanitation means collecting and disposing - in a hygienic manner - of waste, including human excreta, household waste
water and rubbish. If this is not done, neighbourhoods become dirty and people get sick. In South Africa we already have
1,5 million cases of diarrhoea (runny stomach) each year in children under 5, as well as outbreaks of cholera. This must
be accompanied by good hygienic behavioral practices.
Why do we have a problem?
South Africa's sanitation problem has two main causes:
 Poor hygiene (many people don't realise that they need to wash their hands after defecating or changing nappies, and
many think it's fine to use the veld as a toilet),
 Lack of infrastructure (no toilets and no water for hand washing).
What is the solution?
Providing improved toilets is one part of the answer. At the same time there has to be improved community knowledge of
health matters, improved hygiene and community participation in sanitation programmes.
What is the minimum acceptable basic level of sanitation?
 Appropriate hygiene such as keeping toilets clean and washing hands after handling waste or visiting a toilet.
 A system for disposing of human excreta, waste water and rubbish which is affordable, easy to maintain, safe and
environmentally acceptable.
 An adequate toilet for each household.
What will the basic household sanitation policy achieve?
Government has a constitutional responsibility to ensure that all South Africans have access to adequate sanitation. The
policy will therefore focus on providing adequate sanitation for households, schools and clinics, improving household waste
collection and disposal, and educating the public about hygiene.
Government plans to facilitate improved service delivery by supporting communities in providing and using sustainable
(affordable, community-run) sanitation services. Key focus areas will include rural, peri-urban and informal settlements
where the need is greatest.
Sanitation is vital to national health. To achieve good sanitation, the matter needs to be part of an overall development
drive. Sanitation is thus only one of many development programmes being promoted by government. Success also depends
on community support. Sanitation capacity must urgently be built in communities so that citizens are empowered to contribute
to the national sanitation programme.
Sanitation programmes will improve the social and psychological problems associated with poor sanitation. Lack of toilet
facilities, toilets placed at a distance from the home, inadequate communal facilities, inadequate disposal of waste and
other poor sanitation practices result in loss of privacy and dignity, exposure and increased risks to personal safety.
Why is sanitation important?
Sanitation is vital for good health. Health problems associated with poor sanitation include diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid,
cholera, malaria, bilharzia, worm infestations, eye infections, skin diseases and increased infections in HIV positive
people.Good sanitation leads to increased life expectancy.
Sanitation is also vital for wealth creation. Economic benefits of improved sanitation include savings in health costs, higher
worker productivity, better school attendance, improved tourism and reduced water treatment costs. (Source: White Paper
on Basic Household Sanitation)
Who is responsible for better sanitation?
The improvement of sanitation is everybody's business. Roleplayers include communities and households (first and foremost); communitybased
contractors; local, provincial and national government; the private sector and NGOs.
Constitutional responsibilities:
 Municipalities must provide access to basic services, including sanitation.
 National and provincial government must support municipalities with legislation and other measures.
Roles and responsibilities
Households and communities
Households and communities are responsible first and foremost for their own health, a clean environment and improved sanitation. Wrong
hygiene practices can jeopardize their own health and the health of the community and the nation. The following steps can be taken to
improve hygiene practices:
 Washing hands after using the toilet, before handling food and after changing babies' nappies.
 Spreading the message of good hygiene and the importance of sanitation.
 Alerting local government of sanitation-related needs.
 Assisting local government in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating sanitation projects.
 Reporting faulty sanitation systems and sanitation risks to the environment to local government.
 Ensuring that toilet facilities are always clean and in good working order.
Households have to provide their own sanitation facilities. Local government will assist households to do this through:
 Community-based programmes whereby local builders are trained to build safe and hygienic toilet facilities. These local builders will
assist households to construct their own toilet facilities.
 Supplying the essential components to ensure that the toilet facility is hygienic, safe and accessible.
Local government will provide guidelines for households to dig their own pits and build their own top structure.
At different levels of government
Local government
Local government planning takes place through the Integrated Development Plans (IDPs) - of which the Water Service Development
Plans (WSDPs) are a component. In order to implement sanitation improvement programmes, local government must budget and source
funding for this purpose. The funding arises from various sources, including revenue collection and provincial and national government.
Local government must also plan and budget for the operation and maintenance of sanitation systems. It is also responsible for assisting
households to provide their own sanitation and to build their own toilet facilities. Specific responsibilities include:
 Providing access to sanitation.
 Making communities aware of the importance of sanitation in terms of health.
 Launching, together with the communities, health and hygiene promotion programmes.
 Monitoring the health of communities.
 Assisting households to operate and maintain sanitation facilities.
Provincial government
Provincial government must provide finance, human resources and technical support to local government. It must also ensure compliance
with national policy, develop enabling legislation, co-ordinate regional planning and monitor progress.
National government
National government must establish legislation and standards; guide, co-ordinate and monitor national programmes; provide
support to other levels of government; regulate service provision and intervene where there is lack of capacity.
Key government departments
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) is the custodian of the nation's water and the lead department in the sanitation
sector. In partnership with other national role players DWAF must develop sanitation standards, support provinces and municipalities in
developing sanitation services, monitor outcomes, build capacity, provide financial support, undertake pilot projects in low cost sanitation
and make sure that sanitation is implemented in a co-ordinated manner.The Department renders support to local government in developing
their Water Services Development Plans, which is a component of the Integrated Development Plans.
Department of Provincial and Local Government will take primary responsibility for promoting the Integrated Development Plans of
municipalities, ensuring that provincial and local governments have sufficient capacity, providing Equitable Share and municipal infrastructure
grants, and monitoring.
Department of Health will co-ordinate information on public health, create a demand for sanitation through hygiene awareness programmes,
prepare health norms for sanitation, support municipalities, provide training materials and educate communities on hygiene.
National Treasury supports local governments in planning and managing their funding.
National Housing develops standards for housing development (the minimum level for sanitation is a VIP per household unless soil
conditions dictate otherwise). It also co-ordinates the housing subsidy administered by the provincial housing departments.
National Department of Education is responsible for developing curricula and standards, ensuring funding, information and capacity
building. The provincial departments are responsible for the improvement of school infrastructure, including sanitation,
and for implementing the Health Promoting Schools Programme to create safe and healthy schools.
Department of Public Works acts as the implementing agent on behalf of national and provincial government when schools and clinics
are constructed. This department has a responsibility to ensure that adequate sanitation is installed in government and public buildings.
The department is also responsible for implementing the community-based public works programme.
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism is responsible for protecting the environment and will develop standards relating
to the impact of sanitation on the environment and for monitoring impacts and compliance with environmental management procedures.
Other roleplayers
The private sector
Government cannot address the sanitation backlog alone. The private sector, especially business, can manufacture and
install sanitation systems, partner with municipalities in service provision and provide finance.
Non government organisations
These organisations can help with hygiene awareness programmes, facilitate community participation, develop communitybased
construction teams and implement and monitor projects.
How will this all be co-ordinated?
 At local level the District Municipality or Metro or Local Municipality will have primary responsibility for implementation
through the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) of which the Water Services Development Plan (WSDP) is part.
 At provincial level, provincial government will lend support through the Provincial Sanitation Co-ordinating
Forums.
 At national level, co-ordination is achieved through the National Sanitation Task Team (NSTT) which will be reestablished
as a sub-committee of the Municipal Infrastructure Task Team (MITT). DWAF acts as lead department.
What are the time frames?
The White Paper on Basic Household Sanitation was approved by Cabinet in September 2001. At the same time the
Framework for a National Sanitation Strategy was also approved. The Framework is currently being communicated to
stakeholders including district and local municipalities, NGOs, implementing agents, provincial government and any interested
and affected members of public. The document is available on the internet on www.dwaf.gov.za. Provincial and local
strategies will be developed before July 2002. The Framework recommends that a community development approach be
used rather than a contractor driven approach. This will create more jobs and train communities in sanitation skills and
project management.
What kinds of toilets are available?
When choosing toilets or sanitation systems, communities must consider affordability, ease of use and maintenance,
environmental protection, ability of community-based contractors to implement systems and how much the systems will
improve health. Each system listed only works if users have been educated on correct use. Otherwise, toilets break down,
smell bad, attract insects and breed germs. The last three options listed below are not recommended for household use.
Cost indicated is estimated only and will vary according to local conditions.
Unimproved pit toilet (unhygienic and not recommended): A top structure over a pit. Costs vary.
Ventilated improved pit (VIP) toilet: A top structure over a pit, vented by a pipe with a fly screen. The pit may be lined
or unlined depending on soil conditions. Costs start at R600 to build and R60 per year to empty the waste if emptied once
in five years.
Ventilated improved double pit (VIDP) toilet: A single top structure over two shallow pits side by side. Only one pit is
in use at a time and each is vented by a pipe with a fly screen. Pits are generally lined and the central wall is sealed. Costs
begin at R2 500 to install and R35 per year to operate and maintain.
Composting toilets, including urine diversion and desiccating systems: A single top structure over a sealed container
with access for removal of composted waste. Urine may be diverted and a vent pipe helps dry the waste, especially for
desiccating systems. Costs begin at R3 000 for commercial systems and operation and maintenance costs at R35 per
year.
Pour-flush latrine or aqua-privy: A toilet with water-seal. Waste is washed away through a short pipe or chute to a waste
collecting and soakaway disposal system. The privy is accepted internationally where users squat and water is used for
anal cleansing. It fails when people throw unauthorised objects in to the toilet, or there is no affordable emptying service.
Installation begins at R2 000 and removal costs at R150 per year.
Septic tank and soakaway: An in-house full flush toilet connected via plumbing to a watertight underground digester
(settling chamber) with liquids allowed to soak into the ground. Costs to install begin at R7 000 and annual costs at R200,
depending on how often it is emptied.
Flush toilets with conservancy tanks: Waste is flushed into a tank from where it cannot flow into the surrounding
environment and which must therefore be emptied. Costs depend on the size of tank and how often it is emptied.
Small bore solids-free sewer: An in-house flush toilet discharging to a septic tank where solids settle out. Liquids go
through a small sewer into a central collection sump or existing sewer. Costs depend on size of tank and how often it is
emptied.
Full bore waterborne sewerage: An in-house flush toilet which connects to sewer which, in turn, flows to a waste
water treatment plant. This costs R6 000 to install and operating costs are about R400 per year.
Shallow sewerage: An in-house toilet flushed with less water than usual and through smaller pipes at shallower levels
with on-site inspection chambers. Internationally this saves up to 50% on water use but is still being tested in South Africa.
Chemical toilets: Stand-alone units which use chemicals to render excreta harmless and odourless. Expensive
and generally used as temporary. Most authorities are trying to discontinue their use.
Bucket toilet (unhygienic and not recommended): A top structure with a seat over a bucket. The bucket is periodically
removed and contents disposed of. Widely used but poses health risk to collectors. Most authorities are trying to discontinue
these - and they are expensive to operate and maintain.
Communal toilets (not recommended for household use): Toilet blocks may be based on wet or dry systems. These
require regular cleaning and maintenance.
Potential sources of funding
There are three main sources of funding for sanitation improvement: the Equitable Share subsidy, infrastructure grants
and municipalities' own revenue. Part of the housing subsidy can also be used for sanitation.
Equitable Share
This subsidy from national government to local government covers the operating costs of free basic services to the very
poor.
Grants
The Municipal Infrastructure Investment Grant will fund residential properties. Currently DWAF provides a once-off sanitation
subsidy of R300 for community development and R900 for a basic toilet structure (this was preceded by R600 for community
development and R600 for infrastructure).
Municipalities' own revenue
Government is giving attention to cost recovery in providing sanitation services. Municipalities set their own tariffs after
providing the very poor with a free basic level of service.
Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP)
CMIP is funding on-site sanitation as well as bulk and connector infrastructure in urban and rural areas.
Housing subsidies
Currently each household can obtain a once-off subsidy of R16 000 in formalised townships which is used to obtain land,
build houses and provide infrastructure such as toilets. People who have informal land rights to property they occupy may
also qualify for the subsidy. A rural housing improvement grant is also being proposed.
How will the various funds be co-ordinated?
The Integrated Development Plan (IDP) will be used as an interim mechanism to integrate funding and make sure there
are no overlaps.
1. Sanitation must respond to the demands of communities and should link to improved
hygiene awareness. For people to benefit from sanitation improvements, everybody must
understand the link between their own health, good hygiene and toilet facilities.
2. Communities must be fully involved in projects. DWAF is only the regulator. Citizens have
rights but also responsibilities in taking charge of their own health.
3. Sanitation must be provided in conjunction with water supply and other municipal services.
4. Sanitation is more than just toilets; it must be accompanied by environmental and health
education.
5. Access to basic sanitation is a human right.
6. Local government has the constitutional responsibility to provide access to sanitation services.
7. Scarce public funds must be prioritised to help those most at risk.
8. Limited national funds should be fairly distributed throughout the country.
9. Water has an economic value and must be protected through sanitation.
10. Polluters must pay to clean up the water and the environment they have polluted.
11. Sanitation must be financially sustainable.
12. The environment must be protected when sanitation systems are set up and run.
Basic Sanitation Policy Principles

What is Knowledge Management ?
Knowledge Management is a cross disciplinary practice which enables organizations to improve the way they create, adopt, validate, diffuse, store and use knowledge in order to attain their goals faster and more effectively.1[1]2    
1[1]  Eknowledge Centre, Arizona, U.S.A., c 2000, (for many of the definitions given here)

What are the main benefits of Knowledge Management ?
The main benefit is improving the economy of the country, while benefits for other stakeholders include:

Business increasing profitability;

Science increasing innovation; and

Knowledge workers increasing personal growth and motivation.

Is Knowledge Management a quick-fix ?
Knowledge Management will be ongoing and is not a quick fix. World wide, Knowledge Management initiatives are being adopted and there is no longer a choice. Knowledge Management is the way of the future. 

How does Knowledge Management relate to the Information Age ?
The personal computer, Internet and rapid technology advances currently taking place world-wide and especially in America, has led to what is frequently termed the Information Age but which is increasingly seen as a transition step towards the Knowledge Age. As society moves from the Industrial Age towards the so-called the Knowledge Age, at the macro level, Knowledge Management has developed at a micro level to manage the changes. 

Is Knowledge Management new ?
The principles of Knowledge Management are not new, as demonstrated by knowledge developed by early humankind (the utilisation of fire, metal and bronze, for example) being passed on from generation to generation and becoming widespread.  The systematic management of knowledge as a resource is a new and developing field, however, resulting from rapid changes in information and communication technologies as well as a growing appreciation of the value of knowledge as a strategic resource.

What is Knowledge ?
KNOWLEDGE is a resource at least as valuable as the traditional resources land, labour or capital. Managing the need, supply and flow of knowledge is becoming the major strategic advantage of organisations, and can be effectively achieved utilising Knowledge Management.  

Is Knowledge Management different from Information Technology ?
Although information technology (IT) is an enabler of Knowledge Management, IT is but one of over 60 disciplines embraced by Knowledge Management, including Human Resources, Anthropology and Psychology. Knowledge Management is as much about people and culture as it is about IT. 

Is Knowledge Management a technology or an application  ?
Knowledge Management is not just a technology nor is it just an application, but rather a process and a set of technologies all supporting the strategic sharing of institutional memory to enable innovation. 

How does  Knowledge Management relate to people  ?
Central to KM are Knowledge Workers, the stakeholders working in an organisation and who are empowered through knowledge and are responsible for servicing the customers of the organisation. 

KM is about people figuring out how to manage them-selves, as opposed to an autocratic control system. 

Changing the way things were traditionally done, which requires a change in mindset or work culture to one based on confidence and trust. 

The sharing of information will enable staff in an organisation to use existing knowledge rather than reinventing the wheel, enhancing the knowledge. 

This will increase efficient use of time, i.e. productivity, and innovation, which is the production of new knowledge. 

How does Knowledge Management relate to the strategy of an organisation  ?
Another central aspect of KM is the importance of closely linking the Knowledge Management strategy with the organisations business strategy that enables the organisation to develop a competitive advantage and thus exist. 

What is the difference between data, information and knowledge  ?
Data represent observations or facts out of context, and therefore not directly meaningful. Information results from placing data within some meaningful context, often in the form of a message. Knowledge is that which we come to believe and value based on the meaningfully organized accumulation of information (messages) through experience, communication or inference. Knowledge can be viewed both as a thing to be stored and manipulated and as a process of simultaneously knowing and acting - that is, applying expertise.1[2] 
4[2] 5College of Business Administration, North-eastern University, Boston, MA; Sloan Management Review; Managing Codified Codified Knowledge; Michael H. Zack; c. September, 1998

What is a Knowledge Claim  ?
A Knowledge Claim is a set of rules believed to be true by at least one person, in message form with enough information for another person to understand and act on. Some criteria must be used to validate a knowledge claim before being accepted as knowledge. 

Can the quality of knowledge be measured  ?
Yes, by its ability to assist an organisation or individual achieve goals more effectively. 

Is there a Knowledge Management portal or website ?
A Knowledge Management portal has been established to provide an interactive communication channel with the Department of Communications. This will serve as a resource for Knowledge Management, provide knowledge about Knowledge Management and serve as a channel for you to input to a dialogue on Knowledge Management in South Africa. 
Cultivation of litchis 
Temperature and humidity 
* The average maximum temperature in the litchi-producing areas of South Africa should be at least 23 °C during October and 24 °C during November, with a relative humidity of 50 % and higher. 
* The average monthly minimum temperature in areas where litchis are produced should be above 6 °C. Areas where heavy frost occurs are not suitable for litchi production. It should, however, be cold and dry enough in winter to ensure good dormancy. 
* The minimum temperature in some Lowveld areas (Malelane and Komatipoort) does not drop low enough in winter to give the trees the proper dormancy period. Trees can be forced into dormancy by withholding water/irrigation during the 3 coldest months of the year. Producers must, however, ensure that especially young trees do not dry out.

Soil 
* Litchis grow very well, especially in sandy soil in the cooler subtropical areas. 
* However, the trees also grow and produce well in clay soil in warmer areas. 
* Litchis are well adapted to different soil types. 
Water supply 
* Because of the varying root distribution in different soils (deep in sandy soils, shallow in clay soils) water is very important for the optimum development of the plant. 
* In sandy soils short irrigation cycles with small quantities of water are usually effective. 
* In clay soils water is available for longer periods, but it is important that the soil does not become too wet or too dry. 
Drainage 
* Poorly-drained soil or soil with impenetrable layers shallower than 1 m below the surface is not suitable for litchis. 
* Although gravelly or rocky soils drain well, these do not supply enough water to the trees because of poor waterholding capacity. Good irrigation practices, such as wetting the soil more frequently with small quantities of water will make these soils more suitable. 
Cultivars 
Litchis were originally imported from China, India, Taiwan and Florida, USA. Cultivars grown in South Africa are divided into the following groups: 
Mauritius group 
This group is usually planted locally as well as abroad and produces satisfactory yields and fruit of good quality, e.g. H.L.H., Mauritius, Muzaffarpur, Late Large Red, Hazipur, Saharanpur and Rose-Scented. 
Chinese group 
These trees produce very poor yields, but the fruit is of excellent quality and has a high percentage of chicken-tongue seeds. Cultivars include Haak Yip, Shang Shou Huai, Kontand, Glutinous Rice and Three Months Red. 
Madras group 
These trees bear colourful red fruit, but fruit quality is poor. Cultivars include Kafri, Shorts Seedless, Johnstone's Favourite, Emmerson, Durbhanga, Maries, Mooragusha, Madras 19, Hazipur/Saharanpur, Red McLean, Brewster and Bedana. 
Tree quality 
* A good air-layer tree has a single erect stem. The first scaffold branches should branch horizontally at a height of about 200 mm. Any acute forks that branch lower than 200 mm should be avoided. 
* In grafted trees the graft-union height should be about 200 mm from the ground so that the first scaffold branches can branch at 300 mm. The graft union must be strongly attached and nurserymen must remove the grafting strip so that girdling cannot occur. 
Aftercare of grafted trees 
Trees can also be propagated by means of grafting. 
* Weekly aftercare is very important and suckers and wild shoots that develop on the rootstock below the graft wound must be removed. 
* After 5 to 6 weeks the buds start swelling and growing. A small cut can then be made through the plastic next to the bud. The bud grows through this cut, but the plastic strip must not be removed too soon. Once the first new growth has hardened off, the strip can be removed. 
* Grafted trees have a better root system than trees developed from air layers and therefore show rapid initial growth. Air layering is, however, preferred to grafting because of a better end product. 
Soil sampling 
A representative soil sample should be taken for analysis. A soil sample must represent a homogeneous area where there are no visible soil differences. If there are colour or texture differences the land should be subdivided and separate samples of the different parts should be taken. Use a spade to take the samples. 
How deep? 
* Take soil samples up to 300 mm below the soil surface. 
* Take subsoil samples from 300 to 500 mm below the soil surface. 
How many? 
* A sample should consist of not less than 10 subsamples. 
* The area represented by the sample should not exceed 3 ha. 
Where? 
The samples must be taken evenly over the entire area. 
Mixing and packing 
* Mix the subsamples of a particular land thoroughly in a clean container (not a fertiliser bag). Keep the topsoil (0-300 mm) separate from the subsoil (300-500 mm). 
* A 2-kg sample of this mixture is then packed into clean plastic bags or suitable containers. Use separate containers for the top and subsoil. 
* Put a label on the outside of the container to prevent it from becoming illegible. On the label must appear: 
        - Your name 
        - The number of the land 
        - The depth at which the sample was taken. 
Results 
The results will provide valuable information on the type and quantity of fertilisation that should be applied before planting. Remember to incorporate the required quantity of lime about 6 to 12 months before planting if a large quantity is required and phosphate about 3 months before planting. 
Soil preparation 
* Examine the soil for suitability in respect of depth, drainage and compacted layers. It should preferably be 1 to 2 m deep. 
* Prepare the soil according to the results of the soil analysis, especially when large quantities of lime are required. 
* If the soil is suitable for litchi production, it must be prepared well in advance. 
* Before planting, the soil must be tilled as deep and as thoroughly as possible so that it will not be necessary to make the planting holes too big. 
* If the soil is very acid, heavy lime applications may be necessary. Two-thirds of the recommended quantity of lime must be scattered over the planting area, mixed with the topsoil and then ploughed in as deep as possible, at least 9 to 12 months before planting. Calcium (lime) moves very slowly downwards into the soil and must therefore be worked in to the depth of the root zone. 
* A cover crop can then be planted and ploughed in about 6 months later to improve the organic matter content of the soil. The remaining lime (one third) and all the required phosphate must be scattered and incorporated at the same time. The trees can be planted 3 months later. 
* If a lighter lime application (2_4 t/ha) is required, the lime can be worked into the soil at least 3 months before planting and phosphate 1 month before planting. 
Planting 
Remember that litchi trees have a long life and become large. 
* Trees should be planted far apart to eliminate competition and to prevent branches of adjoining trees from growing into each other. 
* The entire outer area of the tree must be exposed to sunlight and air movement. 
Planting distance 
A 25-year-old tree can reach a crown diameter of 12 m. If trees are widely spaced and later become uncontrollably big an economic yield will not be possible. If the trees are to be spaced closely together, size must be controlled from the start by pruning. Try to plant as many controllable trees as possible per hectare. The ideal planting distance is 9 x 6 m. 
Planting the trees 
* Litchi trees can be transplanted any time of the year, but the best time is during spring or at the beginning of the rainy season. 
* Planting holes should be square (in deep-ploughed soil 300 x 500 mm and in nonploughed soil 500 x 500 mm). 
* Mix the topsoil with compost and put it back into the bottom of the hole. 
* When planting the tree, remove the container and loosen the soil around the roots without damaging the roots. 
* After planting, compress the soil slightly by standing on it. 
* Wet the soil around the tree immediately after planting. 
* Place a mulch around the newly-transplanted tree. 
* Irrigate young trees regularly after planting. They must never suffer from a water shortage or too wet conditions. 
Leaf analysis 
Leaf analysis is the only technique according to which sensible fertilisation can be applied to a specific planting. The following aspects are important: 
* The correct time for sampling is from mid-September to mid-November. 
* The correct leaf must be sampled (see figure). 
* The first leaf sample of a specific planting must be accompanied by a soil sample. 
A leaf and soil sample must represent a planting of not more than 3 ha. 
* The sampling method is important: 
- Select about 20 healthy trees, well distributed throughout the planting. 
- The trees must be of homogeneous appearance and representative of the average trees in the planting. 
- Sample 4 leaves per tree. 
- Do not take samples from obviously good or weak trees. 

Sample either of the 2 leaves coloured in the illustration
Fertilisation 
Do not fertilise newly-transplanted trees too soon. Fertiliser should only be applied about 1 year after transplanting. The applications must be very light and broadcast evenly, but not against the stems of the trees. Irrigate after applying fertiliser. 
Application and quantities 
* Fertiliser should be broadcast evenly about 0,2 m from the stem to 0,5 m outside the drip area of the tree. 
* Irrigate lightly immediately after application. Fertilisers must not be worked into the soil. 
* As soon as the trees are established and start growing, fertiliser must be applied regularly according to the quantities given in the table.

Remember: 
This is only a guideline; correct fertilisation can only be applied according to the soil analysis for young trees and soil and leaf analyses for fruit-bearing trees. 
Nitrogen (N) 
First year 
- divide the nitrogen fertiliser into 8 equal monthly applications of 25 g each and apply during summer (September to April). 
Second to fifth year 
- divide the nitrogen fertiliser into 5 equal applications and apply during summer (September to April). 
Sixth year and older 
- half of the nitrogen fertiliser is applied immediately before flowering and the remainder just after harvesting. 
Phosphate (P) 
All the phosphate is applied immediately after harvesting. 
Potassium (K) 
Half of the potassium fertiliser is applied just before flowering and the remainder after harvesting. 
Zinc (Zn) and boron (B) 
Zinc must be applied at least 4 times a year. The following substances and concentrations are recommended per 100 l of water: 
* Zinc oxide at 200 g or 
* Nitro-Zn at 150 ml or 
* Agri-zinc at 50 ml. 
Spray the trees from soon after planting with 100 g borax or 75 g Solubor/100 l water every 2 years. 
Organic fertiliser 
Kraal or chicken manure can be used as additional fertiliser at 2 or 1 kg respectively per mature (10 years) tree, spread evenly in the drip area. However, if no other fertiliser is available, kraal manure can be applied as follows:

Water requirements 
* Litchi trees need regular watering and therefore it is essential that enough water must be available from the flowering stage until after the February/March flush following the harvest. 
* Because the edible portion of the litchi fruit has a water content of 86 %, the availability of water remains important during the development period. 
* A water shortage will delay development of the fruit and adversely affect the size, mass and quality of the litchis. 
* Irrigation must continue after harvesting to ensure that a normal growth flush occurs during February/March, just before the beginning of the dormant period. 
* During dormancy (April to July) irrigation should be reduced, but the tree should not suffer drought. 
* Young trees that are not producing yet are irrigated throughout the year. 
* Producers normally stop irrigating the trees during the coldest months of the year (June and July) so that they can have a proper dormant period. In areas where it is never very cold, irrigation should stop to force the trees into dormancy. 
Covering litchi fruit clusters 
* Covering the fruit with paperbags prevents damage from fruitflies and litchi moths, as well as sunburn and cracking. 
* The best time for covering the clusters will vary from one locality to the next. 
* Paperbags are at present the most suitable and also the cheapest covering material. 
* The fruit develops a very attractive red colour inside the paperbags. 
* Covering the fruit also extends the harvest period because fruit can be left on the tree for a longer period. 
* The paperbag at present used is open at both ends. It is made from reinforced brown paper that is very resistant to the elements. 
* The fruit must, however, be covered in the correct way and during the right time of the day (not early in the morning or immediately after rain), because of the risk of decay when covered while still wet. Spray against litchi moth and fruitflies just before covering. 
* Remove all the leaves on the cluster stem before covering. 
* Do not put more than 25 litchis in one bag. 
* The bags must be fixed to hang to an angle to allow water to flow out. 
o Both sides of the bag must be closed and, if necessary, a small opening must be left for rainwater to run out. The open ends can easily and quickly be stapled together. 
o The paperbags will even keep fruit bats and birds away. 
o Another advantage is that the fruit is handled less during harvesting and this limits damage caused by rough handling. 
o When removed carefully, the bags can be used for another season. 

Insect pests    
* Important pests include bark borers, litchi moth and fruitflies. 
* Consult your nearest extension officer about ways to control these insects. 

Harvesting 
* The stage of maturity at which fruit is harvested is one of the most important factors that determine the ultimate quality at the point of sale. 
* Litchis do not develop further after picking. The fruit must therefore remain on the tree until quite ripe. 
* Litchis harvested too early have an unattractive colour and have a sour taste. 
When are litchis ripe? 
Ripe fruit has an average mass of between 21 and 25 g. Fruit with a mass of at least 21 g is therefore ready for harvesting during a normal season. 
Packing 
Litchis are packed as loose fruit and all unnecessary twigs or stems must be removed to ensure neat packing.

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA 
LAND REDISTRIBUTION FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 


PREVIEW 
The LRAD information booklet provides basic answers to frequently asked questions. This booklet is meant to assist potential beneficiaries and sellers to understand the basic concepts and requirements which must be satisfied in order to benefit from the programme from any point, whether as a seller, agent or beneficiary. 
The booklet is not meant to substitute the policy document (LRAD) or the programme manual, but is merely there to supplement and provide quick answers to basic questions. 
1. What is the LRAD programme? 
The Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development programme was designed to help previously disadvantaged citizens from African, Coloured and Indian communities to buy land or agricultural implements specifically for agricultural purposes. 
2. How does it help people? 
Most of our people do not have sufficient money to buy land for farming purposes. This programme will make some money available to successful applicants to help supplement what they already have for purchasing agricultural land. This will be done in the form of government grants. 
3. What is the LRAD grant? 
It is a nonrefundable form of funding or financial contribution to help prospective farmers to purchase land by government. 
4. How much will I get? 
A formula will to be used to determine how much an individual will get. This formula is based on how much money or inputs to be used in the farming operations on that piece of land (own contribution in kind), or a combination of the two a person contributes towards the purchasing of that particular piece of land or on-farm implements (own financial contribution). 
The grant amount will be determined according to the total own contribution. Refer to Table 1. 
5. What is own contribution? 
The grant will only serve as financial supplementation to what an applicant already has. Own contribution is therefore the money that an applicant should bring into the process to form part of the whole capital package, viz. own contribution + grant. 
6. Is only cash accepted as own contribution? 
There is a number of ways in which own contributions can be made, viz. 
(a) Cash contribution 
An applicant can contribute from a minimum of R5 000, which will qualify for a matching grant of R20 000 up to a maximum of R400 000 which will in turn qualify for a matching grant amount of R100 000. 
(b) Contribution in kind 
There are a number of ways you can contribute in kind, viz. property, machinery, equipment and livestock. These will be equated to their current cash value and the total amount then used as own contribution. 
(c) Own labour 
Any number of labour units will be equated to a maximum of R5 000 own contribution. 
7. What assets can be used as own contribution? 
Existing agricultural assets that are integral to the operation of the land to be acquired through the programme. 
8. What assets cannot be used as own contribution? 
Land that was accessed through an earlier grant, restitution, tenure security grant, donation, etc. 
9. What if I have not yet finished paying for some of my assets? 
Outstanding debt on agricultural assets will not affect the extent to which these will be counted as own contribution. 
10. What is the minimum and the maximum amount that one can get and what is the corresponding own contribution? 
A minimum amount of R20 000 will require a minimum own contribution amount (cash or in-kind) of R5 000 and a maximum of
R100 000 will require a maximum own contribution amount of R400 000. Between the minimum and maximum amounts, there is a continuum of grant amounts, depending on the participant's own contribution (see scale of grant and own contribution). 
11. Why is it that the less money one contributes the larger the grant ratio is? 
This programme is aimed at helping poor people. The grant scale is therefore designed in a way that the less money one has, the bigger the grant to own contribution ratio one wil receive compared to what someone with a bigger contribution will receive. 
12. What can use the grant for? 
(a) Acquisition of land 
(b) Land improvements, infrastructure investments, capital assets and short-term agricultural inputs 
13. Which departments are responsible for the programme? 
Grants will be provided by the Department of Land Affairs, but both the departments of Land Affairs and Agriculture will work in collaboration to oversee the whole process from start to finish. 
14. Who should apply? 
You should 
 Be a member of a previously disadvantaged group (i.e. African, Coloured or Indian) 
 Be 18 years or older 
 Intend to use the land for agricultural purposes only 
 Intend to farm on a full- time basis (except for safety-net projects) 
 Not hold any position within government structures 
 Be prepared to participate in a training programme after land acquisition 
 Be in a position to make an own contribution 
 Be an organised entity if applying as a group 
 Have a bank account 
15. What are safety-net projects? 
The LRAD programme is designed in such a way that beneficiaries will enter the system at various levels of production, viz. 
(a) Safety-net projects 
This is the level at which beneficiaries will acquire land to produce mainly for own consumption. 
(b) Equity schemes 
Members of a group will each contribute a certain amount towards accessing the grant. In turn, each member will own a certain percentage (share) of the project according to the degree of their contribution. This share is called equity, and it will be equal to the value of each individual's contribution plus the grant. These shareholders will be both co-owners and employees of the farm. 
(c) Production for markets 
Some people will enter the programme at a much higher level than the ones mentioned above. These people will most probably have more farming experience as well as access to additional finance through normal bank loans as well as their own assets and cash to purchase bigger farms and therefore farm on a much larger scale. 
(d) Agriculture in communal areas 
Quite a number of people in communal areas already have secure access to agricultural land, but may not have the money to start using that land productively. Such people will be allowed to apply for assistance to start putting up productive investments on the land. These kinds of projects may either be at the lower scale of production (safety-net projects) or higher up (production for markets). 
16. What type of land am I allowed to buy under this programme? 
Any agricultural land in South Africa, regardless of its present tenure status, is potentially eligible for redistribution under this programme, except communally-held land in former homeland areas. 
17. Can one obtain land and still be working somewhere else? 
One of the requirements is that the applicant should be committed to farm on a full-time basis, except in the case of food safety-net projects, where the beneficiaries will only be producing enough for consumption. 
  
18. What what kind of assistance will I get from the government after I have obtained land? 
The Department of Agriculture has a post-settlement support services framework in place to assist farmers. Training will be provided periodically and field officers will be available in all districts to offer technical assistance to all farmers, emerging as well as commercial. 
19. What kind of documentation will be expected from me? 
 Land use proposal/farm plan (project proposal). 
 An option to sell with an agreed price, if leasing with an option to buy. 
 A list of household members or group members, if the proposal is for a group. 
 Confirmation that the title to the land is clear, free from land claims, registered in the name of the seller and that the negotiated price is not higher that the appraised market price. 
 Evidence of availability of remainder of financing (own funds or contingent loan contract). 
 Valuation report. 
20. Where can I go for assistance regarding the professional preparation of the above documentation? 
Applicants may do all the planning themselves, or may choose to accept the assistance of a design agent. It is not compulsory to employ one if you feel that you can undertake and fulfil all the requirements. District officers will also assist applicants if needed. 
If you decide to appoint a design agent, you can do so by accessing the list of agents at provincial land reform offices or provincial agricultural offices. These agents will then undertake all the necessary work and a planning grant will then be made available for their payment.

South Africa's media history reflects the fissures and divisions within society as well as the distribution
of power. The challenge of democratic transformation affects all spheres of social life, including the
institutions and practices of the media.
Government is committed to creating an agency to promote access to the media by marginalised
groups and to enhance media pluralism. This follows a Cabinet decision based on a Comtask
recommendation in 1996. It is in accordance with the Constitution, Bill of Rights and the
Reconstruction and Development Programme and is further motivated by the National Action Plan
for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, which emphasises freedom of expression and
media diversity, and the need for mechanisms to ensure that this is achieved. It follows an unsuccessful
attempt by civil society to form such a body in the early 1990s.
The motivation for an independent, separately located and cost-effective Media Development and
Diversity Agency (MDDA) rests on the need for a body of respected media specialists and other public
figures that will, through funding, facilitation and research, develop expertise around media development
and diversity and ensure their realisation. It will operate on the best principles of corporate
governance with a mandate and requisite resources. It will operate at arms length from government,
the media industry and other donors.
As the world moves rapidly towards an information society, it is critical that all citizens have access
to the widest range of information and opinion in order to participate effectively in an increasingly
integrated world at local, national and international levels. Government has made access to information
integral to its reconstruction and development programme.
The MDDA, like the programme of Multi-Purpose Community Centres, is a key initiative towards this
objective. It will help alter the communications environment in a way that builds infrastructure and
fosters the emergence of media reflecting the experiences and perspectives of the marginalised. In
other words, while the MDDAwill not by itself bring about the complete transformation of the media,
it will, through its funding, facilitation, advocacy and research functions, play a key catalytic role in
altering the media landscape in a way that will be conducive to broader changes.
Media development involves promoting an enabling environment to help redress exclusion and
marginalisation of groups and interests from access to media - as owners, managers and producers of
media. Media diversity is about ensuring that all interests and sectors have affordable access to a range
of views and information sources fully reflective of our society. The achievement of diversity is also facilitated
by the availability, to a diverse range of media, small and large, of the means of distribution.
The Media Diversity A g e n c y
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Defining media development and diversity:
The Media Development and Diversity A g e n c y
- a draft position paper
Whilst much has been done since the advent of democracy to address problems of media development
and diversity, it has clearly not been enough. The density of media infrastructure per capita
remains low. Media ownership is still concentrated and does not meet the needs of all groups and
interests. Representivity is still inadequate at management, editorial and general staffing levels.
South African experience has shown that market forces, opportunities for licences and changes in
ownership on their own cannot fully achieve this transformation. An agency like the MDDAis needed.
International experience shows that support schemes to promote media development and diversity
are not new. They have been implemented in Europe since the 1950s on the basis that market forces
alone would not achieve sufficient diversity. Indeed, the evidence is that the market on its own tends
towards increased concentration, which can inhibit freedom of expression and a diversity of views.
An earlier attempt to form a voluntary support mechanism, the Independent Media Diversity Trust,
eventually failed for lack of funding. This has reinforced the view that only initiatives firmly rooted in a
partnership of government and the media, and underpinned by statutory authority, will have a sustainable
impact.
The MDDAwill be an independent, statutory body operating on the basis of government policy and
guidelines. However, it will have an arms-length relationship with government, the private sector and
any other donors. Its mandate will be to promote diversity and development in print, broadcast and
"new media".
The MDDAwill have a Board nominated by Parliament through a public process, and appointed by
the President. The Board will appoint a CEO. The CEO will, in conjunction with the Board, appoint a
small highly skilled and adequately resourced staff.
It will seek collaboration with bodies dealing with telecommunications, licensing, film and video, to
achieve coordination and avoid duplication. Apart from its primary role of media support, it will commission
research and make recommendations to government, the media industry and other relevant bodies.
The MDDAwill relate to all bodies with a direct or indirect interest in media development and d i v e r s -
i t y, amongst them the Independent Communications Authority of SA(Icasa). The MDDAwill hold an
Annual Review Forum where such bodies will consider the MDDA's annual report.
The main beneficiaries of direct and indirect support will be community and other non-profit media, as
well as small commercial media, including radio, television, print and new media. There will be particular
emphasis on projects that bring disadvantaged communities and sectors - particularly women,

The character of the MDDA and its relationship with other bodies:
The beneficiaries and the nature of the support:
Drawing on experience:
rural people, the disabled, illiterate people, working class and poor people - into the information and
communications loop.
Support will be of a funding and non-funding nature, and will include direct and indirect subsidies;
emergency funding; capacity development; encouraging social responsibility support in the broadcast, print
and new media sectors; training; project evaluation and monitoring; and media research. It will also make
recommendations in support of media seeking loan finance, on the basis of its evaluation procedures.
In addition, the MDDAwill work towards the emergence of national and provincial common carriers,
and/or the implementation of common carrier principles, in the print industry, to ensure equitable
access for small publications, and into under-serviced communities.
The MDDA's guiding principle in making funding decisions and loan recommendations will be the
contribution that projects make to media development and diversity. It will seek to promote sustainability,
and to fund projects that have good governance practices. Other considerations include community
representation and participation and equity plans.
The MDDAneeds adequate financing to cover community media network, training, capital and operational
costs, as well as feasibility studies for small commercial media projects. It will commission
research on media development and diversity, as well as regular performance evaluations of funded
projects. Its operational needs, including performance evaluations of projects, should represent no
more than 12% of total costs.
The resources needed to overcome the current barriers to media development and diversity amount
to a total of R500m, over five years. It is envisaged that the MDDAwill meet 60 per cent of these
needs, which amounts to R300m over five years, or on average R60m per year.
This would be made up by R20m per year from each of government, the media industry and donors.
It should be noted that government's contribution would include the support for community radio
infrastructure development already given through the Department of Communications, currently at a
level of R7 million per year.

CODE OF CONDUCT FOR UNIFORMED MEMBERS OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENCE FORCE
I pledge to serve and defend my country and its people in accordance with the Constitution and the law and with honour, dignity, courage and integrity.
I serve in the SANDF with loyalty and pride, as a citizen and a volunteer.
I respect the democratic political process and civil control of the SANDF.
I will not advance or harm the interests of any political party or organisation.
I accept personal responsibility for my actions.
I will obey all lawful commands and respect all superiors.
I will refuse to obey an obviously illegal order.
I will carry out my mission with courage and assist my comrades-in-arms, even at the risk of my own life.
I will treat all people fairly and respect their rights and dignity at all times, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, culture, language or sexual orientation.
I will respect and support subordinates and treat them fairly.
I will not abuse my authority, position or public funds for personal gain, political motive or any other reason.
I will report criminal activity, corruption and misconduct to the appropriate authority. 
I will strive to improve the capabilities of the SANDF by maintaining discipline, safeguarding property,
developing skills and knowledge, and performing my duties diligently and professionally.
RULES OF WAR
In situations of armed conflict I will abide by the rules of international humanitarian law as contained in the Geneva Conventions:
I will fight only enemy combatants and attack only military objectives.
I will employ methods of attack to achieve the military objective with the least amount of harm to civilian life and property.
I will not attack or harm enemy personnel who surrender. I will disarm them and treat them as prisoners of war.
I will not kill, torture or abuse prisoners of war.
I will not alter weapons or ammunition for the deliberate purpose of increasing suffering.
I will collect and care for the wounded, shipwrecked and sick, whether friend or foe.
I will treat all civilians humanely.
I will not tolerate or engage in rape or looting.
I will respect all cultural objects and places of worship.
I will respect all persons and objects bearing the Red Cross, Red Crescent and other recognised symbols of humanitarian agencies.
I understand that disobeying these rules is a crime. It dishonours military personnel and their country, and makes them liable to punishment as war criminals. I will therefore report any violation of the rules to my superiors.
The strategic plan for South African agriculture is the product of cooperation between Government, Agri SA and NAFU.
Early in 2001 President Thabo Mbeki requested the different role-players to identify a mutual strategy that would provide enough focus to unite the sector. From this request followed the strategic sector plan.
The vision for the sector implies sustained profitable participation in the South African agricultural economy by all stakeholders. It recognises the need to maintain and increase commercial production, to build international competitiveness and to address the historical legacies and biases that resulted in skewed access and representation. It gives a clear picture of where South African agriculture wants to be in the long term.
The strategic plan consists of three core strategies:
 Equitable access and participation
The objectives of this strategy are to enhance equitable access to and participation in agricultural opportunities; to deracialise land and enterprise ownership; and to unlock the full entrepreneurial potential in the sector.
 Global competitiveness and profitability
The aim of this strategy is to enhance profitability through sustained global competitiveness in the agricultural sector's input supply, primary production, agriprocessing and agritourism industries.
 Sustainable resource management
This strategy aims to enhance farmers' capacities to use resources in a sustainable manner and to ensure the wise use and management of natural resources.
Some elements of the core strategies are complementary and will contribute towards creating and restoring confidence in agriculture. With this in mind, the task team identified a number of essential supporting and enabling strategies:
 Good governance
 Integrated and sustainable rural development
 Knowledge and innovation
 International cooperation
 Safety and security
These complementary strategic objectives provide the critical foundation without which the strategic goal will not be realised. They also emphasise the dependence of the sector on the support of other government cluster departments and industries.
The partners who have tasked themselves with the responsibility for the plan's implementation will also produce the detailed action plans. To this end, the leading partners will establish the permanent joint committee. They are also making an effort to involve organised labour, NGOs, community-based organisations and foreign organisations.
As a first step to move the strategic plan closer to implementation, the strategic partners identified the following priority programmes and actions:
 Implementing the broad-based safety and security strategy for good working and social stability, trust and confidence
 Fostering a shared vision on agriculture, good governance and social partnerships
 Fast tracking the programme of land redistribution for agricultural development and processes of empowerment for targeted groups
 Transforming agricultural research, transfer of technology, education and extension to be more responsive to markets
 Redefining the mandate of agricultural marketing and international trade in the post-control board era against greater global competition and demands for market access, infrastructure and information
 Building credible agricultural statistical and economic analysis systems that will be accessible to all farmers and enterprises
 Establishing the integrated rural financial services system outlined by the Strauss Commission Report
 Developing an effective integrated risk management system for plant and animal health systems, price and income systems and natural disasters
 Targeting investment in rural development nodes to provide livelihoods, infrastructure, irrigation, electricity, telecommunications, transportation, training and skills development
 Establishing an agricultural cooperation programme for Africa to spearhead the New Africa Initiative in agriculture
 Lowering the overall cost of production, including a further reduction in the taxes and duties on diesel and other inputs.
In all of this, they recognise the valuable role of the private sector in achieving the goals of participation, competitiveness and sustainability.
Therefore everything will be done to ensure greater collaboration and coordination between government and the private sector-implying farmers, farmers' organisations and agribusiness-in order to attain the new vision of a united and prosperous agricultural sector.
The following outcomes are expected from the successful pursuit of these strategic objectives:
 Increased wealth creation in agriculture and rural areas
 Increased sustainable employment in agriculture
 Increased incomes and increased foreign exchange earnings
 Reduced poverty and inequalities in land and enterprise ownership
 Improved farming efficiency
 Improved national and household food security
 Stable and safe rural communities, reduced levels of crime and violence, and sustained rural development
 Improved investor confidence and greater domestic and foreign investment in agricultural activities and rural areas
 Pride and dignity in agriculture as an occupation and sector
The partners commit themselves to providing the necessary time and financial and material resources to see to the successful implementation of the strategic plan.

1. What is a National Qualifications Framework (NQF)?
It is a framework i.e. it sets the boundaries - a set of principles and guidelines which provide a vision, a philosophical base and an organisational structure - for construction, in this case, of a qualifications system. Detailed development and implementation is carried out within these boundaries. It is national because it is a national resource, representing a national effort at integrating education and training into a unified structure of recognised qualifications. It is a framework of qualifications i.e. records of learner achievement.
In short, the NQF is the set of principles and guidelines by which records of learner achievement are registered to enable national recognition of acquired skills and knowledge, thereby ensuring an integrated system that encourages life-long learning.

2. Why has South Africa chosen a National Qualifications Framework?
In 1994 the international community witnessed the birth of a new democracy and welcomed the new South Africa as the most recent member of its global village. In accepting that honour, this country took on the associated challenges of that position.
Many countries all over the world are looking for better ways of educating their people and organising their education and training systems so that they might gain the edge in an increasingly competitive economic global environment. Furthermore, the world is an ever-changing place, politically, geographically and technologically. Indeed, the rapid technological advances of the twentieth century have placed education systems under extreme pressure as they try to adapt and incorporate these changes in an effort to produce more creative, effective and adaptable people. Success, or even survival, in such a world demands that South Africa has a national education and training system that provides quality learning, is responsive to the ever-changing influences of the external environment and promotes the development of a nation that is committed to life-long learning.
When learners know that there are clear learning pathways which provide access to, and mobility and progression within education, training and career paths, they are more inclined to improve their skills and knowledge, as such improvements increase their employment opportunities . The increased skills base of the workforce has a wider implication namely the enhancement of the functional and intellectual capability of the nation, thereby increasing our chances for success in the global community.
Sir Christopher Ball (1996) in describing the kind of learner profile that is suited to the 21st century, spoke about 'flexible generalists'. Ball maintained that such people are needed to realise the goal of life-long learning which, with the ever-increasing human longevity, will characterise the successful citizenry of the next millennium. 'Flexible generalists' are people equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to adjust readily to multiple career changes and make, through their own personal development, a significant contribution to the life of this country and the world. The shift in thinking is from education for employment - developing the ability to do a specific job - to education for employability - developing the ability to adapt acquired skills to new working environments. The new education and training system must be able to support the notion of an adaptable workforce.

3. How did the NQF come into being? A brief history
The NQF traces its origins back to the labour movement of the early 1970s. From the early 1970s, black trade union demands for a living wage were repeatedly rejected by employers, on the grounds that workers were unskilled and therefore their demands were unjustified. This in turn led to black workers seeing training as a means to achieving their demands for better wages. The struggle to persuade employers to accede to worker demands continued into the 1980s and in 1989 the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), established a research group comprising workers and union officials, to formulate recommendations on training. On the assumption that skills development would lead to better wages, an integrated proposal was formulated, based on a staged improvement in skills, linked to grading increments. The proposal stressed the need not only for basic education, without which workers would not be able to access the proposed system, but also for portability and national recognition of training so that workers would not be at the mercy of a single employer. The proposal was formally adopted by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in July 1991.
The mid-1970s also witnessed a demand for change in education, spearheaded by the non-governmental education sector. Protest was epitomised in the Soweto student uprising of 1976, which was followed by nation-wide student protest. By the 1980s the entire education system had been discredited and rejected. Non-governmental education sector resistance resulted eventually in the formation of the National Education Policy Initiative (NEPI), which set about developing proposals for the restructuring of the formal education system. Drawing on discussions with a wide range of interested parties within the democratic alliance, the NEPI reports and framework, published in 1992, were premised upon the principles of non-racism, non-sexism, democracy and redress, and the need for a non-racial unitary system of education and training. COSATU was closely involved with the NEPI process - an alliance which continued through the period leading to the democratic elections of 1994.
Despite repeated resistance to worker and student demands for change, the government of the day came increasingly to appreciate the inappropriateness, and ultimately the unsustainability, of its rejection of such demands. The announcement by President de Klerk in 1990 of the government's intention to dismantle apartheid gave added impetus to, and was symptomatic of, the change of policy towards worker and student demands. The Department of Manpower, through the National Training Board (NTB), embarked as far back as the 1980s upon a number of initiatives, notably the restructuring of the apprenticeship system into a competency-based modular training system run by autonomous industry training boards. However unions viewed the process as flawed, not only because it excluded workers, but also because the proposals emanating from the initiatives were narrowly focussed on apprenticeship to the exclusion of basic education, which was seen as a point of access to the skills training. After an extended conflictual relationship, the Department of Manpower and the trade union federations reconvened in 1992 in an attempt to renew the process.
The Department of Education simultaneously initiated its own process of policy discussion, which culminated in the Education Renewal Strategy (ERS). The democratic alliance within the education sector was invited to participate in the process, but declined the invitation on the grounds that the initiative lacked legitimacy. Furthermore the ERS advocated three streams - academic, vocational, and vocationally-oriented - a system the democratic alliance found unpalatable. The education employer sector did, however, participate in the process, advocating a seamless framework similar to that adopted by Scotland and New Zealand.
The 1992 meeting of the Department of Manpower and the trade union federations resulted in the formation of a representative Task Team, which established eight working groups charged with developing a new national training strategy. The working groups had representation from trade unions, employers, the State, providers of education and training, the ANC Education Department, and the democratic alliance. Working Group 2 reached agreement on a new integrated framework. 1994 saw the publication of three documents which laid the foundation for the SAQA Act (RSA, 1995): the ANC Policy Framework for Education and Training (1994); the Discussion Document on a National Training Strategy Initiative (1994); and the CEPD Implementation Plan for Education and Training (1994). White papers on Education and Training (1995) and on Reconstruction and Development (1994) followed, both of which underscored the need for the development and implementation of the NQF.
An Inter-Ministerial Working Group was established to draft the NQF Bill which was passed into law as the South African Qualifications Authority Act (No. 58 of 1995) on 4 October 1995. The appointments to the first Authority were made in May 1996 and the first meeting of the Authority under the chairmanship of Mr S B A Isaacs, was held in August 1996.

4. What are the objectives of the NQF?
The objectives of the NQF as outlined in the SAQA Act are as follows:
* To create an integrated national framework for learning achievements; 
* Facilitate access to, and mobility and progression within education, training and career paths; 
* Enhance the quality of education and training; 
* Accelerate the redress of past unfair discrimination in education, training and employment opportunities; 
* Contribute to the full personal development of each learner and the social and economic development of the nation at large. 

5. What is the relationship between the NQF and outcomes-based education?
Qualifications and standards registered on the NQF are described in terms of the learning outcomes that the qualifying learner is expected to have demonstrated. Hence there is an underlying commitment to a system of education and training that is organised around the notion of learning outcomes.
of the criticisms of the past system of education in South Africa was that certain institutions were privileged above others because of the policy of unequal allocation of resources to learning institutions, based on race. In addition, as a result of this financial discrimination, the perception grew that the standard of provision at these institutions was superior to that of other institutions. Consequently, students from these institutions were granted preferential treatment in access to further education opportunities and in the labour market. In other words, where the qualification was obtained was more important than what qualifying students actually knew and could do. In addition to problems of access, there was the problem of portability in that institutions arbitrarily chose to recognise or not to recognise qualifications achieved at other institutions; employers actively sought graduates from certain institutions and ignored graduates from other institutions. The impact of such practice on the economic and social fabric of our society is self-evident. There is hence an historical imperative in the fragmentation of our society, to focus on what it is that a learner knows and can do rather than where the learner did his or her studying. It is necessary to address the inappropriate social use of qualifications that has been part of our history.
A further pressing imperative to base our NQF on outcomes has emerged from global trends and discussions. Ronald Barnett's discussion of competence in higher education epitomises the kinds of transition that are taking place in education and training systems the world over:
The new vocabulary in higher education is a sign that modern society is reaching for other definitions of knowledge and reasoning. Notions of skill, vocationalism, transferability, competence, outcomes, experiential learning capability and enterprise, when taken together, are indications that traditional definitions of knowledge are felt to be inadequate for meeting the systems-wide problems faced by contemporary society. 
Whereas those traditional definitions of knowledge have emphasised language, especially through writing, an open process of communication, and formal and discipline-bound conventions, the new terminology urges higher education to allow the term knowledge to embrace knowledge-through-action, particular outcomes of a learning transaction, and transdisciplinary forms of skill (Barnett, 1994: 71)
If South Africa is to take up its position in the global village, it needs to embrace the new vocabulary of which Barnett speaks: competence and outcomes. Countries in Europe, the Pacific rim, Australasia, and North America have either adopted or moved in the direction of a national qualifications framework, underwritten by a commitment to outcomes-based education. South Africa cannot afford to ignore these developments. The South African NQF with its emphasis on the notion of applied competence - the ability to put into practice in the relevant context the learning outcomes acquired in obtaining a qualification - is already contributing to these debates and developments.
Associated with the recognition that knowledge needs redefinition is the recognition that sites of learning are many and varied. The traditional definitions of knowledge have implicitly designated formal institutions of learning as the primary site of learning. This perception has been re-enforced by the fact that in most instances, a qualification is awarded by an institution, before any further learning in a practical environment is obtained by the learner. In other words, the sub-text is that once the qualification has been awarded, learning is over - and unless a learner registers for a new, formal qualification, learning for life is over! This bias towards qualification-as-destination is at odds with reality and also with what the White Paper on Education and Training (1995: 15) identifies as the education and training requirement of a successful economy and society:
Successful modern economies and societies require the elimination of artificial hierarchies, in social organisation, in the organisation and management of work, and in the way in which learning is organised and certified. They require citizens with a strong foundation of general education, the desire and ability to continue to learn, to adapt to and develop new knowledge, skills and technologies, to move flexibly between occupations, to take responsibility for personal performance, to set and achieve high standards, and to work co-operatively.
If one accepts that there is more than one dimension to knowledge and hence that learning continues both before and after a qualification has been awarded in a variety of sites of learning, then in order to achieve integration and coherence within the system so that access and portability can become a reality, it is necessary to clearly articulate the outcomes of learning achievements.
Finally the South African Qualifications Act (No. 58 of 1995) indicates that one of the functions of the South African Qualifications Authority is to ensure that standards and qualifications registered on the NQF are internationally comparable. Since the global trend is moving towards describing qualifications in terms of achieved learning outcomes, articulation of South African qualifications with their international counterparts is facilitated if our qualifications are described in terms of the learning outcomes.
The NQF with its commitment to outcomes-based education and training is the means that South Africa has chosen to bring about systemic change in the nature of the education and training system. This systemic change is intended to transform the manner in which the education and training system works as a system, how it is organised and the vision that drives participants within the system as they perform their own particular roles and functions within that system.

6. What are the Critical Outcomes?
The Critical Cross-field Education and Training Outcomes, commonly known as the Critical Outcomes, are an additional mechanism through which coherence is achieved in the framework. These Critical Outcomes describe the qualities which the NQF identifies for development in students within the education and training system, regardless of the specific area or content of learning i.e. those outcomes that are deemed critical for the development of the capacity for life-long learning. These outcomes are intended to direct the thinking of policy makers, curriculum designers, facilitators of learning as well as the learners themselves.
It is mandatory for standards setters to incorporate at least some of the Critical Outcomes in the standards that they recommend and proposers of qualifications must ensure that all Critical Outcomes have been addressed appropriately at the level concerned within the qualifications being proposed.
The Critical Outcomes adopted by SAQA are as follows:
* Identify and solve problems in which responses display that responsible decisions using critical and creative thinking have been made; 
* Work effectively with others as a member of a team, group, organisation, community; 
* Organise and manage oneself and one's activities responsibly and effectively; 
* Collect, analyse, organise and critically evaluate information; 
* Communicate effectively using visual, mathematical and/or language skills in the modes of oral and/or written presentation; 
* Use science and technology effectively and critically, showing responsibility towards the environment and health of others; 
* Demonstrate an understanding of the world as a set of related systems by recognising that problem-solving contexts do not exist in isolation; 
In order to contribute to the full personal development of each learner and the social and economic development of the society at large, it must be the intention underlying any programme of learning to make an individual aware of the importance of:
* Reflecting on and exploring a variety of strategies to learn more effectively; 
* Participating as responsible citizens in the life of local, national and global communities; 
* Being culturally and aesthetically sensitive across a range of social contexts; 
* Exploring education and career opportunities, and 
* Developing entrepreneurial opportunities. 

7. What do NQF qualifications look like?
The NSB regulations indicate that a qualification shall:
* Represent a planned combination of learning outcomes which has a defined purpose and which is intended to provide qualifying learners with applied competence and a basis for further learning; 
* Add value to the qualifying learner by providing status, recognition, enhancing marketability and employability; 
* Provide benefits to society and the economy; 
* Comply with the objectives of the NQF; 
* Include both specific and critical cross-field outcomes that promote life-long learning; 
* Where applicable, be internationally comparable; 
* Incorporate integrated assessment appropriately to ensure that the purpose of the qualification is achieved. Assessment should include a range of formative and summative assessment methods such as portfolios, simulations, workplace assessments and also written and oral examinations; 
* Indicate in the rules governing the award of the qualification that the qualification may be achieved in whole or in part through the recognition of prior learning, which concept includes but is not limited to learning outcomes achieved through formal, informal and non-formal learning and work experience. 
There is provision in the regulations for the registration of qualifications constructed from unit standards as well as the registration of whole qualifications, not constructed from unit standards. Unit standard means registered statements of desired education and training outcomes and their associated assessment criteria together with administrative and other information as specified in the regulations. Both formats of qualification structure however require the specification of learning outcomes, the latter format requiring the articulation of exit level outcomes and associated assessment criteria.
There is much debate about the ability or desirability of reaching agreement on learning outcomes at a national level, and furthermore, about describing learning outcomes in the form of applied competence standards. SAQA has placed the requirement for participation in national stakeholder processes only for those qualifications and standards that are to be registered on the NQF - national recognition requires acceptance by national stakeholders. Furthermore constructors of qualifications and standards can choose to be rigid or choose to be flexible in the construction of the qualifications and standards, allowing for choice or not. The strength of the NQF processes is that representatives of all key stakeholders in the learning area and not just a select few will make those decisions. Furthermore, through the required process of review all qualifications and standards must be reviewed regularly to ensure that the agreed criteria and requirements are feasible, relevant and desirable. If there is agreement that changes are necessary, there is ample opportunity for those changes to be adopted.
A more complex issue is raised by the notion of learning outcomes and competence standards. Some people raise the problem that the learning outcomes of certain qualifications and standards can relatively easily be described by in the form of competence standards e.g. the draft standards for Engineering qualifications. However, in the case of other qualifications, this is more difficult because the learning outcomes are less obvious or less precise. Any effort to try and establish national agreement will result in a loss of creativity and originality when in fact, it is that very creativity and originality that gives them value. SAQA is of the opinion that the description of a NQF qualification addresses this question i.e. a qualification shall represent a planned combination of learning outcomes which has a defined purpose and which is intended to provide qualifying learners with applied competence and a basis for further learning.
In describing the purpose of qualification, standards setters will have to give consideration as to what the purpose of the qualification is and how it contributes to the learner's development and further learning.
Furthermore the notion of applied competence suggests a broadening of the behaviourist notions of knowledge usually associated with outcomes and competence models. Applied competence suggests that foundational competence, practical competence and reflexive competence are all necessary for the meaningful accomplishment of a task in any real world context. Foundational competence is described as an understanding of what is being done and why. Practical competence is described as a demonstrated ability to do a particular thing. Reflexive competence is described as a demonstrated ability to integrate or connect performance with the understanding of that performance so as to learn from the actions and adapt to change and unforeseen circumstances.
Hence the challenge for standards setters is the attainment of a balance between society's needs and the needs of the individual; the development of learning outcomes that are precise enough to indicate the purpose of the qualification but general enough to permit flexibility in delivery, choice of content, assessment methodology; a balance between the need for practical competence and the need for foundational and reflexive competence; the adoption of qualification construction, possibly through electives, that encourages creativity, originality and experimentation without jeopardising the primary purpose of the qualification.
Qualifications and standards are registered at specific levels of the framework and have a credit value. Learners, in the course of study, may accumulate credits over time towards a qualification.

9. What is the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA)?
The South African Qualifications Authority is a body of 29 members appointed by the Ministers of Education and Labour. The members are nominated by identified national stakeholders in education and training. The functions of the Authority are essentially twofold:
* To oversee the development of the NQF, by formulating and publishing policies and criteria for the registration of bodies responsible for establishing education and training standards or qualifications and for the accreditation of bodies responsible for monitoring and auditing achievements in terms of such standards and qualifications; 
* To oversee the implementation of the NQF by ensuring the registration, accreditation and assignment of functions to the bodies referred to above, as well as the registration of national standards and qualifications on the framework. It must also take steps to ensure that provisions for accreditation are complied with and where appropriate, that registered standards and qualifications are internationally comparable. 
SAQA must advise the Ministers of Education and Labour. The Authority is required to perform its tasks after consultation and in co-operation with all bodies and institutions responsible for education, training and certification of standards which will be affected by the NQF. It must also comply with the various rights and powers of bodies in terms of the Constitution and Acts of Parliament. The office of SAQA is responsible for implementing the policies and decisions of the Authority.
In 1998 SAQA published the National Standards Bodies (NSB) Regulations whereby provision was made for the registration of National Standards Bodies and Standards Generating Bodies. These bodies will be responsible for the generation and recommendation of qualifications and standards or registration on the NQF. The Education and Training Quality Assurance (ETQA) regulations were also published in 1998 and provided for the accreditation of Education and Training Quality Assurance bodies. These bodies will be responsible for accrediting providers of education and training standards and qualifications registered on the NQF, monitoring provision, evaluating assessment and facilitating moderation across providers, and registering assessors.

10. What are the structures of SAQA and what is their purpose?
The NQF standards setting and quality assurance processes embrace two basic tenets:
Knowledge, relevant for the current world, is created through partnerships between and amongst varied groupings in society, from academics and researchers to business, from workers to professional experts, from government to community organisations, from learners to professors i.e. knowledge creation is no longer the preserve of narrowly-defined groups of 'experts';
The national system of education must balance the need for quality education for all its citizens with the need for flexibility to cater for the wide-ranging circumstances that face learners and the wide-ranging options in what constitutes relevant education and qualifications i.e. a balance between society's needs and the needs of the individual.
The first of these tenets is addressed in the structures that SAQA has in place. SAQA itself is made up of representatives from education and training stakeholders in South Africa. Membership of the NSBs also reflects these new partnerships in the creation of knowledge - the NSBs are made up of representatives from six national stakeholder bodies with a key interest in the field: State departments, organised Business, organised Labour, providers of education and traing, critical interest groups and community/learners organisations. Traditionally few of these partners have sat down together to discuss education and training needs for the country. Furthermore, members of the SGBs are nominated from key education and training stakeholder interest groups in the sub-field, again recognising that relevant knowledge creation is brought about through discussion on a broader front.
The NQF's commitment to outcomes-based education and training as the means for bringing about systemic change in the nature of the education and training system in South Africa addresses the second tenet. By describing national standards and qualifications in terms of learning outcomes through a participatory process, the NQF is placing the national demands in respect of quality, before the citizens of the country. No longer can the nation tolerate a situation where the range of competence that exists between holders of the same qualification is so wide that the employers of the qualifying students cannot be sure of what the competences are; no longer can the nation tolerate discrimination against learners on the basis of perceptions of what their competences are; no longer can the nation afford to ignore global standards in qualifications. In short, the learning outcomes, standards and qualifications, must be clear so that there is no doubt as to what is expected of qualifying learners.
By the creation of Education and Training Quality Assurance bodies (ETQAs), SAQA has recognised that delivery of the standards and qualifications is the preserve of the professional providers and learners and other key stakeholders in the field. Different qualifications and standards will make different demands on curriculum development and delivery, on assessment and teaching. SAQA's concern is not in ensuring that all providers follow a national programme of delivery but rather in ensuring that the learners who are awarded a registered NQF-qualification or standard are able to demonstrate the learning outcomes of the qualification or standard in accordance with the described criteria and requirements. SAQA therefore will not register learning programmes on the NQF; however ETQAs will evaluate the learning programmes of different providers in a process of accreditation, thereby assuring learners and other users of the system that any learner who has been deemed successful after participating in that learning programme, has displayed the learning outcomes required for that qualification or standard. The best group for ensuring that this will be the case, is a body made up of representatives of stakeholders, active in the area of the qualification or standard i.e. the ETQA which has that area as its primary focus. For that reason, in respect of its quality assurance functions, an ETQA must have national stakeholder representation at decision-making level, which representation shall ensure public accountability and transparency.
SAQA has two 'arms' i.e. Standards Setting and Quality Assurance. The sub-structures in the standards setting arm are the National Standards Bodies (NSBs) and the Standards Generating Bodies (SGBs), while the sub-structures in the quality assurance arm are the Education and Training Quality Assurance bodies (ETQAs). SAQA may choose to appoint moderating bodies if it deems it necessary. The functions of SAQA are set out in the SAQA Act and have already been outlined above. The functions of the NSBs and SGBs are set out in the Regulations under the South African Qualifications Authority Act (Act No. 58 of 1995): NSBs, Government Gazette No. 18787 (28 March) while the criteria for accreditation and the functions of the ETQAs as well as providers of education are set out in the Regulations under the South African Qualifications Authority Act (Act No. 58 of 1995): ETQAs, Government Gazette No. 19231 (8 September).
In the NQF all learning is organised into twelve fields. SAQA has established twelve NSBs, one for each organising field. The twelve organising fields are as follows:
NSB 01: Agriculture and Nature Conservation
NSB 02: Culture and Arts
NSB 03: Business, Commerce and Management Studies
NSB 04: Communication Studies and Language
NSB 05: Education, Training and Development
NSB 06: Manufacturing, Engineering and Technology
NSB 07: Human and Social Studies
NSB 08: Law, Military Science and Security
NSB 09: Health Science and Social Services
NSB 10: Physical, Mathematical, Computer and Life Sciences
NSB 11: Services
NSB 12: Physical Planning and Construction

The functions of NSBs include the following:
* Defining and recommending to SAQA the boundaries of the field and, within this, a framework of sub-fields; 
* Recognising or establishing SGBs within the framework of sub-fields, and ensuring that the work of the SGBs meets SAQA requirements; 
* Recommending the registration of qualifications and standards to SAQA; 
* Overseeing the update and review of qualifications and standards; 
* Liaison with ETQAs; 
* Defining requirements and mechanisms for the moderation of standards and qualifications. 
NSBs do not generate standards or qualifications but rather oversee these activities at the sub-field level.
The functions of SGBs include the following:
* Generating standards and qualifications in accordance with the Authority requirements in identified sub-fields and levels; 
* Updating and reviewing standards; 
* Recommending standards and qualifications to NSBs; 
* Recommending criteria for the registration of assessors and moderators or moderating bodies . 
An ETQA may be established in a social sector, in an economic sector or in an education and training sub-system sector. The principle of minimum duplication will apply in the establishment of ETQAs i.e. an ETQA is accredited in respect of its primary focus, based upon its association with the sector, so that its functions do not duplicate the functions of an existing ETQA. The functions of ETQAs include the following:
* Accrediting providers; 
* Promoting quality amongst constituent providers; 
* Monitoring provision; 
* Evaluating assessment and facilitating moderation among constituent providers; 
* Registering assessors; 
* The certification of learners 
* Co-operating with relevant moderating bodies; 
* Recommending new standards or qualificatiosn to NSBs or modifications to existing standards and qualifications; 
* Maintaining a database; 
* Submitting reports to SAQA. 
ETQAs do not set standards; they assure the quality delivery and assessment of registered standards and qualifications. Furthermore an ETQA may not be a provider; its primary function is to assure the quality of provision and assessment of providers it has accredited.
In seeking accreditation from ETQAs, providers will have to fulfil the following criteria:
* Be registered as a provider in terms of applicable legislation; 
* Have a quality management system; 
* Be able to develop, deliver and evaluate learning programmes which culminate in specified NQF qualifications or standards; 
* Have the necessary financial, administrative and physical resources; 
* Have policies for staff selection, appraisal and development; for learner entry, guidance and support systems; for the management of off-site practical or work-site components; for the management of assessment; 
* Have necessary reporting procedures; 
* Have the ability to achieve the desired outcomes using available resources and procedures. 
SAQA recognises the need for accommodating providers in the system that do not meet all the criteria for accreditation. In such cases SAQA allows for provisional accreditation during which time the provider shall undergo a programme of development which is designed to enable the provider to meet the required criteria for accreditation. Furthermore provisional accreditation will only be granted if the interests of the learner are protected during the development period.

11. How will quality in assessment be maintained?
has been specific in identifying forms of assessment that could be used to ensure that attention is given to exploring alternatives to the traditional once-off written examination. Indeed a review of the critical outcomes clearly indicates the inappropriateness of such forms of assessment for many of those skills. Alternative assessment methods place a greater demand on the system to ensure that there is fair and consistent interpretation of the required standard among assessors at different provider institutions and registered in different ETQAs i.e. the prevention of 'standards drift'. If different standards are applied across the system, the credibility and integrity of the whole system is placed in jeopardy. To ensure that this does not occur, SAQA has put a number of checks in place.
Every standard or qualification submitted for registration of the NQF must:
* articulate the assessment criteria for the learning outcomes; 
* stipulate the criteria for the registration of assessors of those outcomes, and 
* indicate moderation options including the recommendation of a moderating or moderating bodies for those outcomes. 
Therefore, the proposers of qualifications and standards have an important role to play in setting clear, unambiguous standards and associated assessment requirements.
Furthermore, among the functions of an ETQA are the following:
* to evaluate assessment and facilitation of moderation among constituent providers; 
* to register constituent assessors in terms of the criteria established for this purpose; 
* to co-operate with the relevant body or bodies appointed to moderate across ETQAs. 
Hence in the quality assurance process, there is considerable emphasis on the process of moderation to ensure the application of comparable standards across providers.
Finally, SAQA has the right to appoint a moderating body, if it sees fit, to ensure that assessment of the outcomes described in NQF qualifications and standards is fair, valid and reliable across different ETQAs or providers.

12. How does SAQA ensure acceptance of its policies by stakeholders?
The SAQA Act clearly states that the NQF must be set up after consultation and in co-operation with those bodies and institutions responsible for education, training and certification of standards affected by the NQF.
The fact that the SAQA Act clearly articulates the need for SAQA to do its work in a spirit of consultation and co-operation indicates the commitment of the new democratic government to the principles of representation and participation of all relevant stakeholders in society's institutions. This emphasis on inclusiveness has its roots in a history of exclusion of large sectors of the community from important decision making processes in education and training. For example, the skills to be developed and the content of a learning programme in the past were constructed by the so-called experts in the field, usually academics rooted in formal institutions of learning i.e. 'providers' of education, with little or no consultation with the 'users' of the qualifications i.e. business, labour unions, learners. This led to the frequently cited criticism that there was little match between what was taught in formal institutions of learning and what was required in the world of work or even for further study. Furthermore, there was little co-operation or consultation between previous ministries of Education and Manpower; across industries or companies or with the state; between providers of formal education and providers of training. This meant that there was no means to align learning across different providers or courses - qualifications remained sectorally-based, geographically-based or institution-based with little or no formal articulation between allied learning areas.
In spite of the culture of consultation and co-operation in decision-making in the new South Africa, the most logical reason for representivity in decision-making about what learning outcomes for a particular qualification should be, is the question of relevance. For South Africa to remain responsive to changes in the environment, it is essential that all relevant voices in the field of learning are heard, the state, the academics, the business world, the labour market, the providers of education and training to name a few. An inclusive approach to standards setting and the construction of qualifications will enable new trends to be taken into account swiftly, thereby ensuring that South Africa is at the cutting edge of international developments.
SAQA is committed to a process of public consultation in the development and execution of policy. Qualifications and standards are required to go through a process of narrow consultation with stakeholders in the field and a process of broad consultation, whereby the public at large is provided with an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed standards. Furthermore all qualifications and standards are submitted to a Reference group which comprises organisations representing the disabled and marginalised sectors of the community, for comment, before registration, in an effort to ensure that proposed standards and qualifications do not discriminate unfairly against any of these sectors of the community.
In the execution of its quality assurance functions, ETQAs are required to have national stakeholder representation. The main purpose of this representation is to ensure public accountability and transparency. In addition all policy documents of SAQA are drawn up through an open consultation process with relevant stakeholders and while in draft form, are published in the Government Gazette for public comment. All nominations to SAQA structures, excluding Authority members, are published in the Government Gazette prior to appointment, to enable public comment. In addition, all documents requiring public comment and all SAQA publications in the Government Gazette are posted on the website (http://www.saqa.org.za). In this way SAQA ensures social transparency and inclusivity in its work.
An education and training system that is constructed through a process of participation and negotiation in order to meet the needs of all stakeholders enjoys greater legitimacy and credibility in the society within which it operates than would otherwise be the case. Furthermore SAQA, the guiding body in the South African system, is an impartial "overseer" i.e. it not a state department or an arm of government, it is not an initiative of business, nor of labour, nor is it allied to the education provider sector. For this reason, SAQA is independent of the agendas of each of these sectors and as such, is able to retain its integrity in facilitating negotiations between education and training stakeholders which sometimes have conflicting interests.
The SAQA Act is an example of enabling legislation - it does not hand down a blueprint from 'on high' but rather enables the development of the NQF as a social construct whose meaning has been, and will continue to be, negotiated by the people for the people. It is a synthesis of the experience, thinking and practice of South Africans from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds representing a variety of world-views. The cornerstones of this construct are democratic participation, intellectual scrutiny and the availability of resources - notions central to SAQA's development and implementation of the NQF.

13. How does SAQA ensure that quality is a feature across the NQF?
The objectives of the NQF underpin the notion of quality in the new system. Moreover the NQF supports a comprehensive quality cycle which includes standards setting and quality assurance. Every standard and qualification before being registered on the NQF is measured against the principles enunciated in the objectives of the NQF, to ensure that it meets the criteria for an integrated qualifications framework that supports life-long learning. In the same way, the foundation for national and international assurance of achievement of these standards rests upon the way in which they reflect these same principles and objectives.
By bringing these principles together in the social construction process, the standards developed through the participatory and representative structures and processes of the NSBs and SGBs and then registered on the framework, will have their delivery and achievement assured, for all users of the learning system through the ETQA system. This system in turn, reflects participatory and representative structures and processes. It is in assuring the quality of both the standards and achievements that the quality cycle of the framework is closed. It is through closing the cycle that the system allows ongoing improvements both in the construction of standards and qualifications and in the delivery and assessment of these standards and qualifications, by the users of those standards and qualifications. In other words, the NQF is a system of assuring and continually re-assuring learners and other users of the education and training system that credits, awards or certificates issued during the learning process adhere to the standard registered on the framework, and that all forms of provision deliver learning to the same standards for accreditation purposes. The inclusive nature of the quality cycle ensures that the responsibility for setting standards and for delivery of quality education and training rests with the education and training stakeholders who participate in the SAQA processes.

14. How does SAQA acknowledge Recognition of Prior Learning(RPL)?
Among the objectives of the NQF are the need to facilitate access to, and mobility and progression within education, training and career paths as well the need to accelerate the redress of past unfair discrimination in education, training and employment opportunities. SAQA is challenged to find a way in which these two objectives can be met, to find a way to recognise the learning that has taken place outside traditional learning contexts, previously the only learning contexts that were formally recognised. SAQA has indicated its intention to engage its structures in the area of RPL as a means of giving practical meaning to these objectives.
SAQA has mentioned RPL directly in the NSB regulations and has also made reference to it in the ETQA regulations. In the NSB regulations, the criteria for the registration of a qualification are outlined. One of these requirements is that the proposal should indicate in the rules governing its award, that the qualification may be achieved in whole or in part through the recognition of prior learning. The point is made that the concept of RPL includes but is not limited to learning outcomes achieved through formal, informal and non-formal learning and work experience.
In the ETQA regulations one of the criteria for accreditation as an ETQA is that the activities of the ETQA must advance the objectives of the NQF and hence in accordance with these objectives, policies and procedures for RPL are also the responsibility of the ETQA and hence will be considered in the accreditation process.

15. What else does the SAQA Office do?
SAQA is responsible for the development and maintenance of a National Learners' Records Database (NLRD). The first version of the NLRD was launched in 1999. Once fully established and populated, the NLRD will be able to provide information about:
* SAQA and its sub-structures (NSBs, SGBs and ETQAs); 
* Qualifications and standards registered on the NQF; 
* Accredited ETQAs and their providers; 
* Registered assessors; 
* Moderating bodies; 
* Individual learner achievements. 
The NLRD will be able to provide policy makers with comprehensive information to enable informed decision-making.
SAQA has the task of evaluating educational qualifications, especially if foreigners who wish to attend South African education institutions or who wish to enter the South African labour market.
SAQA also has a Resource Centre that keeps copies of SAQA publications and SAQA-related documents as well as other material that SAQA staff may need in the course of their work.
The Communications and Secretariat division provides SAQA with a secretarial service for the Authority and its sub-committees required in the execution of its duties e.g. the Executive Committee, the Finance Committee.

CHAPTER 2
THE NATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FRAMEWORK
Establishment 
2. A National Qualifications Framework is hereby established to provide for the registration of national standards and qualifications. 
Structure of the National Qualifications Framework 
3. (1)The National Qualifications Framework shall consist of eight-levels, which shall be entitled Levels 1 to 8, and each level shall be described by a unique level descriptor. 
(2) Level 1 of the National Qualifications Framework shall be open-ended and shall accommodate three sub-levels for Adult Basic Education and Training for which certificates of achievement may be awarded, and level 8 shall be open-ended.
(3) The eight levels of the National Qualifications Framework shall be grouped into three bands which shall be defined as follows: 
a. Level 1 and below: General Education and Training band 
b. Levels 2 to 4: Further Education and Training band 
c. Levels 5 to 8: Higher Education and Training band 
(4) The National Qualifications Framework shall be divided into twelve organising fields, which shall be: 
d. Field 01: Agriculture and Nature Conservation 
e. Field 02 :Culture and Arts 
f. Field 03 :Business, Commerce and Management Studies 
g. Field 04: Communication Studies and Language 
h. Field 05: Education, Training and Development 
i. Field 06: Manufacturing, Engineering and Technology 
j. Field 07: Human and Social Studies 
k. Field 08: Law, Military Science and Security 
l. Field 09: Health Sciences and Social Services 
m. Field 10: Physical, Mathematical, Computer and Life Sciences 
n. Field 11: Services 
o. Field 12: Physical Planning and Construction 
(5) The Authority shall allocate a unique field description to each organising field and shall divide each organising field into sub-fields to each of which the Authority shall allocate a unique sub-field description.
Level descriptors 
4. (1) Each National Standards Body contemplated in regulation 12, shall engage with the Standards Generating Bodies contemplated in regulation 20, in the field for which the National Standards Body was established, to produce the guidelines for level descriptors contemplated in regulation 3(1) with exemplars, which will explain their process of assigning levels to standards, other components of qualifications and qualifications. 
(2) The Authority shall prescribe level descriptors in consultation with the National Standards Bodies in order to ensure coherence across fields and to facilitate the assessment of the international comparability of standards and qualifications.
Assignment of levels to standards and qualifications 
5. (1) The assignment of levels to standards, other components of qualifications and qualifications shall occur as follows: 
a. Each National Standards Body contemplated in regulation 12 together with each Standards Generating body contemplated in regulation 20 shall reach agreement on the level of each unit standard and standard submitted, on a scale of eight levels as envisaged in regulation 3, taking into account the way in which both the breadth and the depth of knowledge, skills and values in a specific sub-field have been advanced by learning, and the way in which one or more of the critical outcomes is seen to be a distinctive although contextual part of the prescribed outcome of the unit standard concerned. 
b. The proposers of unit standards-based qualifications shall construct, through appropriate rules of combination of selected unit standards registered at different levels, qualifications which have exit level outcomes that are a function both of the particular component standards used, and of a process of integrating the overall outcome, again considered as reflecting the extent (on a scale of 1 to 8 as contemplated in regulation 3) to which knowledge, skills and values in a sub-field have been acquired and the critical outcomes incorporated, into the assessable performance. 
c. The proposers of qualifications not based on unit standards shall construct combinations of learning outcomes which have exit level outcomes that are a function of the most advanced outcomes included and of a process of integrating the overall outcome, considered as reflecting the extent (on a scale of 1 to 8 as contemplated in regulation 3), to which knowledge, skills and values in a sub-field have been acquired and the critical sub-field outcomes incorporated into the assessable performance as a whole. 
Registration of standards and qualifications on the National Qualifications Framework 
6. Each standard and qualification which meets the requirements in regulations 7 and 8 shall be registered on the National Qualifications Framework by the Authority and each shall be identified by a unique description. 
Requirements for the registration of unit standards and standards .

What is the SAHRC?
The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) is made up of a
Commission and a Secretariat.
The Commission
The chairperson is the Reverend Dr Barney Pityana and the deputy chairperson
is Ms Shirley Mabusela. The Commission has up to eleven commissioners,
including the chairperson and the deputy chairperson.
The Secretariat
The chief executive officer heads the Secretariat. It has 4 departments:
???Education, Training and Information
???Legal Services
???Research and Documentation
???Finance and Administration
The SAHRC has committees made up of commissioners, staff and outside
members. They work in the following areas:
???Policy and Planning;
???Government and Parliamentary Liaison;
???Legal and Constitutional Affairs;
???NGO and Statutory Body Liaison;
???International Liaison;
???Disability; and
???Children.
In addition, each commissioner has special responsibility for one or more
provinces. They visit the provinces to build relationships with structures there,
analyse trends and respond to complaints.
What does the SAHRC do?
The SAHRC was set up by the Constitution to:
???develop a culture of human rights in South Africa;
???educate South Africans about human rights;
???investigate human rights violations and find ways of correcting them
(including taking cases to court, if necessary);
???undertake research on human rights in South Africa and internationally;
???advise government on human rights and check how government promotes
and protects human rights;
2
???monitor laws written at all levels of government (local, provincial and
national) to make sure they observe human rights; and monitor what
government does to make sure people have access to socio-economic
rights (environment, housing, health care, food, water, social security and
education).
Reporting human rights violations
A human rights violation is when any of the rights in the Bill of Rights are abused
or violated. However, the SAHRC does not handle all violations. Some cases are
referred to other organisations and structures set up to deal with specific kinds of
violations. These include:
The Commission for Gender Equality (discrimination cases on the grounds of
sex or gender); Tel: 011-403 7182
The Public Protector (complaints against government officials);
Tel: 012-322 2915/6
The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (cases of unfair
labour practice); Tel: 011-377 6894
The Independent Complaints Directorate (complaints against the police);
Tel: 012-428 5700
If your case is one of these, you should rather contact these organisations
directly. Advice and assistance with your case may also be obtained from Legal
Aid Boards (situated at Magistrates' Courts), or from Legal Aid Clinics (at most
universities). Also, there are many NGOs (such as Lawyers for Human Rights,
Legal Resources Centre and Black Sash), which might also be able to help you.
How to report human rights violations to the SAHRC
If your case is a violation of one of the rights in the Bill of Rights, and it is not the
type of case dealt with by another organisation, you can report it to the SAHRC
by:
Phoning an SAHRC office. A member of staff will either take a statement, send
you a complaints form or make an appointment for you to come to the office in
person. Or
Sending a fax or letter to the Legal Services Department of the SAHRC in the
language of your choice. Or
Getting a complaints form from the SAHRC, completing it and returning it to the
SAHRC.

CHAPTER M
CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE
M1 DEFINITION
In this Chapter any word or expression to which a meaning has been assigned in the Act, bears the meaning so assigned thereto, and "this Act" means the Public Service Act, 1994, and the regulations issued in terms thereof.
M2 PURPOSE
M2.1 In order to give practical effect to the relevant constitutional provisions relating to the Public Service, all employees are expected to comply with the Code of Conduct provided for in this Chapter.
M2.2 The Code should act as a guideline to employees as to what is expected of them from an ethical point of view, both in their individual conduct and in their relationship with others. Compliance with the Code can be expected to enhance professionalism and help to ensure confidence in the Public Service.
M3 INTRODUCTION
M3.1 The need exists to provide guidelines to employees with regard to their relationship with the legislature, political and executive office-bearers, other employees and the public and to indicate the spirit in which employees should perform their duties, what should be done to avoid conflicts of interests and what is expected of them in terms of their personal conduct in public and private life.
M3.2 Although the Code of Conduct was drafted to be as comprehensive as possible, it does not provide a detailed standard of conduct. Heads of department are, in terms of section 7(3)(b) of the Act, inter alia responsible for the efficient management and administration of their departments and the maintenance of discipline. They may therefore, after the matter has been consulted in the appropriate Chamber of the Public Service Bargaining Council, and without derogating from it, supplement the Code of Conduct provided for in this Chapter in order to provide for their unique circumstances. Heads of department should also ensure that their staff are acquainted with these measures, and that they accept and abide by them.
M3.3 The primary purpose of the Code is a positive one, viz. to promote exemplary conduct. Notwithstanding this, an employee shall be guilty of misconduct in terms of Section 20 (t) of the Public Service Act, 1994, and may be dealt with in accordance with the relevant sections of the Act if he or she contravenes any provision of the Code of Conduct or fails to comply with any provision thereof.

Rabies
a killer disease

* Symptoms of rabies 
 
* Prevention 
 
* Treatment 

Rabies 
What is rabies?
* Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease which people can get from animals) 
 
* It is caused by a virus which affects the brain and causes death 
 
* The virus is shed in saliva and is spread by the bite of an infected animal 
 
 
 
 
Rabies is a very dangerous disease. Vaccinate your animals and protect yourself!
Animals which can infect people
* Usually dogs 
 
* Other animals which can infect people are cats, mongooses, jackals and other wild animals 
 
* Rabies is spread to other animals and people mainly by dogs, black-backed jackals, yellow mongooses and bat-eared foxes 
 

Signs of the disease in animals
* Changes in behaviour occur in all animals. Domestic animals can become wild and aggressive (they appear to be mad), while wild animals may become tame 
 
* Paralysis eventually occurs, resulting in death 
Distribution of rabies, showing which animals are important for the spread of rabies in each region

Dogs: aggression, howling, attacking without warning, salivation, biting at imaginary flies, fixed stare, wandering aimlessly, dropped lower jaw, inabililty to swallow, eating soil and sticks, choking, vomiting, difficulty in walking, paralysis
Cats: become very aggressive and attack without any prior warning signs
Cows:bellowing, salivation, choking, aggression, wind-sucking, inability to swallow, weakness, knuckling over of feet, difficulty in walking, paralysis
Horses: aimless staggering, inability to swallow, difficulty in walking, weakness, paralysis, aggression, biting

Donkeys: biting, aggression
Goats and sheep: bleating, hind-leg weakness, difficulty in walking, aggression, excessive sexual activity, paddling
Wild animals: appear tame, enter homes and gardens, night animals seen during the day, attack people and objects without any prior warning signs, paralysis
Pigs: aggression, bite savagely

How are people infected? 
* People are infected when they get bitten by an infected animal because the virus is spread in the saliva 
* It is possible for people to be infected by saliva through contamination of cuts, the mouth or eyes 
* Animals with rabies may appear to have something stuck in the throat as they salivate excessively. You should take care not to place your hands inside the mouth, because you can contract the disease if you get bitten or cuts on your hands are exposed to saliva 
* Infected carcasses of cattle, sheep, goats, horses and donkeys may be a health threat if these are cut open, because it is possible for people to be infected through cuts or by splashes of brain or saliva into the eyes or mouth when cutting open the skull and handling the brain of an infected animal 
Signs of the disease in people
* In people, the first signs of disease are headaches, anxiety, fever, vomiting and fear of water. Finally, paralysis, coma and death results 
* It normally takes 2 to 10 weeks for people and animals to show signs of the disease after being bitten by an infected animal 
* Once people or animals actually show signs of rabies no treatment is possible and they will die 
Prevention 
* It is very important that dogs and cats are vaccinated to reduce the risk to people and animals 
* Young animals should be vaccinated twice in the first year and then every 3 years, or as often as required by your state veterinary authorities. The vaccine is safe and will not make your animals sick 
* Notify your state veterinarian immediately if you see animals acting strangely and rabies is suspected 
* Do not handle, or go near, strange animals, wild animals that seem tame and do not run away from you, sick animals that are not properly restrained or animals that appear aggressive 

Treatment 
* If you get treated in time (as soon as possible after the bite) you will not die from rabies 
* If bitten, you should quickly wash the wounds well, using soap or a disinfectant if possible. Then seek medical attention immediately from the nearest clinic or doctor 

* The doctor or nurse will start a course of injections, which can prevent rabies developing. It is very important that you continue going to the clinic until the course is completed, because you can die if you do not get all the injections 
* The recommended vaccination programme at present is to give the first injection on the day you are bitten, and the others 3, 7, 14 and 28 days later 
* A rabies antiserum injection will also be given on the day you are bitten 

* You should notify the state veterinarian or police when you are bitten by a dog or other animal. They will then investigate and if necessary destroy the animal making sure it is tested for rabies

Do I have to pay school fees?
The school may ask you to pay school fees. However, if you cannot afford the required amount or can pay a lesser amount a lesser amount, you may write a letter to the school governing body (SGB), requesting exemption from paying school fees. The school governing body will inform you of its decision. A copy of the regulations dealing with school fees is obtainable at the school. The school must also assist you if you need help with your application for exemption.
How do I appeal against the decision of the SGB?
You can lodge an appeal with the Head of Department in the province. S/he will explain the reasons if you were not granted exemption.

What does the Language-in-Education Policy say?
The Department's Language-in-Education Policy encourages learners to learn more that one language. It also encourages them to use the language that they best understand as the language of learning and teaching and to maintain this language throughout as they learn other languages as subjects or add other languages as languages of instruction. 
Will my child not be disadvantage by being taught in a language other than English? 
Learning in the first formal schooling years in the home language ensures a solid foundation for future learning, as well as the acquisition of new/other languages.
Who decides on the language of learning and teaching?
The school governing body must decide on the language of learning and teaching used in a school. The language used will depend on the preference of the majority of learners in the school and the ability of the school to teach in the preferred language. In addition, the school governing body needs to indicate how it will promote multilingualism in the school.
Does my child have options regarding the language of learning and teaching in a school?
Yes. Each learner must, upon registration at a school, indicate the preferred language of learning and teaching. Any of our eleven languages may be indicated as the language of learning and teaching in a public school.
What if the school does not offer my choice?
Should there be 40 requests per Grades 1-6 or 35 per Grades 7-12 for instruction in a language not already offered in a school, the provincial department will need to find means of meeting your need.

What are my responsibilities as a parent with regard to payment of school fees?
Schools may charge school fees in order to supplement the funds provided by the Department of Education. As a parent you are responsible for paying your child's school fees. If you cannot afford part of or the entire amount, you must apply for exemption as soon as possible from the school governing body. The school governing body will assess your situation and let you know of its decision. Note that, if you have not been exempted from paying and it is determined that you can afford to pay school fees and you fail to do so, legal steps may be taken against you to ensure that you pay any outstanding amount.
How can I contribute towards the development of the school?
The South African Schools Act gives the school governing body the responsibility to strive for the development of the school. There are many ways in which the school governing body can do this. One of the ways is to encourage parents, learners, educators and other staff to render voluntary services to the school.
As a parent, you have a responsibility to contribute towards the development of the school by rendering services to the school. This may include making yourself available to participate in the activities of the school such as the maintenance of school property, auditing of financial statements, managing sports events etc
What role can I play in supporting the learning process of my child?
Your child is in the custody of the school staff when s/he is at the school. The school staff can successfully carryout their teaching responsibilities if they receive the support of the parents.
As a parent you have the responsibility to:
· assist with the discipline of your child;
· monitor your child's educational progress;
· ensure that s/he completes her/his homework;
· ensure that s/he attends school;
· liaise with the school staff.

How can I keep abreast of the developments at the school?
Parents of learners must take responsibility for attending school meetings that are organised for them. The school governing body is legally bound to report to the parents of learners at the school form time to time and should keep parents informed about issues that affect them.
(Note that you have the right to request any additional information of your interest form the SGB and the principal of the school.)

TAPEWORM

What you should know about beef tapeworms
* Beef tapeworms live in the food canal of people. 
* A tapeworm is flat, white and very long (up to 10-15 metres). 
* Its body consists of many segments as shown in the picture. 
* New segments are formed at the neck. 
* Segments are pushed downwards to the end of the worm as new ones are formed. 
* The segments at the end of the body mature/develop. This means that they are filled with eggs. 
* These segments become loose and either leave the body of the human passively with the excreta or crawl out of the anus. 
* Every time the segment moves, it deposits thousands of eggs on every surface it comes into contact with. 
* People get beef tapeworms by eating beef which has not been cooked well and which contains measles. 
* Cattle get measles by grazing on pastures soiled by the excreta of humans who have beef tapeworms. 
* They also get measles from animal handlers who are infected with beef tapeworms, when the worms crawl out of the handlers and infect the kraal, feed and water-troughs. 

Beef with measles 
* After the tapeworm eggs have been ingested by cattle, they hatch in the food canal. 
* The young worms go through the wall of the food canal and enter the bloodstream. 
* The worms reach the muscles (beef) through the blood and become fixed there in the form of measles. 
* Measles in beef look like little white sacs filled with water. 
If you are infected with beef tapeworms, you will 
* always feel hungry 
and lose mass 
This is because beef tapeworms are parasites which absorb the food you need. 
They allow you to digest the food you have eaten and then use the digested food for their own growth, leaving very little for you. 
This will lead to 
* stomach cramps 
* headaches 
* dizziness 
* tiredness. 
How do you know you have beef tapeworms? 
The mature segments can move on their own. They leave the human body through the anus and move around on your clothes. 
Therefore: 
* you wil feel uncomfortable and itchy around the anus 
* you will see flat, white, fleshy sacs in your underwear, on your clothes and even shoes 
* you will see long, white strips in your excreta. 
What to do if you think you have beef tapeworms 
* If you see something strange in your underwear or in your stool, collect it in a bottle or bag and take it to your clinic for examination. 
* At the clinic they will do tests and prescribe medicine to kill the worms. 

Remember! 
* People are often too embarrassed if they suspect that they have beef tapeworms to discuss the matter with someone who can help them. 
* But it is better to be healthy than to be ashamed and ill! Tapeworms can be very dangerous. 
* Do not delay if you think you have worms. You are not only neglecting your own health but you are spreading the worms and infecting other people as well. 
* Speak to the doctor or nurse today! 
 
How to prevent tapeworm infection
* Do not buy meat from informal (unregistered) butchers because it may have measles. 
* Make sure that you eat meat which is well cooked. This will kill the measles. 
* Do not eat raw meat. 
* If you suspect that beef contains measles you must freeze it for at least 3 days at a very low temperature before eating it (-18 °C). 
* Use proper toilets. Never use the veld as a toilet. 
How to prevent measles in your cattle if you are a farmer
* Provide proper (clean) toilet facilities for your herdsmen. 
* If toilets are well-ventilated, people are more inclined to use them. Unventilated toilets cause 
a foul repugnant odour. 
* Inform your employees (workers) about tapeworm infection. 
* Provide treatment for your employees against beef tapeworm. 
* Keep your animals in fenced pastures-do not let them graze on roadside verges because inconsiderate travellers frequently defecate there. 
Why should you prevent measles in your cattle? 
* You must ensure that you produce safe food for the consumer. 
* You will get less money for your beef if your cattle are slaughtered at a controlled abattoir where proper meat inspections are carried out and your cattle are found to be infected with measles. 
* Beef containing measles will infect more people, which in turn will infect greater numbers 
of cattle! 
How will you know that your cattle are infected with measles? 
* There are no signs (symptoms) in cattle infected with measles. 
* When you slaughter your cattle on the farm, carry out meat inspections by making a few cuts in the jaw muscles and inspecting the cut surface for white, water-filled sacs.
Can you treat your cattle for measles? 
* Yes, but it is VERY expensive. 
* Cattle can be reinfected after treatment. 
* All the cattle should be treated, because there are no signs to make detection easy. 
Substitute the vicious cycle with a good cycle! 
* Beef tapeworms and measles in beef represent a vicious health-threatening cycle-we can 
all prevent it in our daily food chain. 
* The farmer, butcher and consumer also create a cycle for food production. 

Everyone has to cooperate in ensuring a healthy cycle 
The farmer - by implementing good farming practices 
- by taking precautions to limit exposure of cattle to measles. 
The butcher - by protecting clients 
- by ensuring the beef sold is properly inspected for measles. 
The public- by supporting the farmers in producing safe food 
- by being considerate and maintaining good hygiene at all times. 
Prevention is better than cure!

TICK-BORNE DISEASES 
IN RUMINANTS
Jenny Turton

What are tick-borne diseases?
* Tick-borne diseases are diseases which are spread between animals by the bite of an infected tick 
* Ticks become infected by feeding on animals that are either sick from disease, or are healthy but have the parasite in their blood (carriers) 
* Ticks infect animals when they feed on them, through their saliva 
* A single infected tick can pass disease on to an animal 

Important tick-borne diseases in ruminants
* Heartwater in cattle, goats and sheep 
   
* Redwater in cattle 

* Gallsickness in cattle 


Which tick species transmit the different diseases? 
* Heartwater: bont ticks 

Male 

 Female 
* Redwater: blue ticks 

Male 

Female 
* Gallsickness: blue ticks, others also important (such as red-legged tick) 

Male red-legged tick 
  
Gallsickness can also be spread from one animal to another by biting flies and by blood on instruments and needles (eg during vaccinations, injections, dehorning and castration)

Where do the different tick-borne diseases occur? 
 The diseases occur wherever there are ticks

Distribution of heartwater 

Distribution of gallsickness 

Distribution of redwater
African redwater--dark area
Asiatic redwater and African redwater--lighter area


How important are tick-borne diseases? 
 Tick-borne diseases can cause heavy losses of animals 
 They can prevent the introduction of high-producing animals to upgrade or replace local stock 
Which animals are most at risk from tick-borne diseases, and when is disease most likely? 
* Exotic (European) breeds (tropical breeds like the Nguni and Brahman tend to be more resistant) 

* Older animals 
* Goats and sheep are more at risk 
from heartwater than cattle 
* Animals moved from disease-free areas to disease areas 
* Animals born in winter (not exposed to parasites when young) 

* Disease is most likely after good rains, because then there are more ticks 
           

Signs in sick and dead animals 
* The disease can range from mild to severe, depending on different factors like species, age, protection, tick control, climate, season and seriousness of parasite strain 
* The early signs for all diseases are often loss of appetite, depression and weakness, and lower milk production in milking animals 
* Pregnant animals can abort 
Heartwater 
Sick animals 
* Fever (40 ×C or higher) 
* Nervous signs 
- Nervous signs are more obvious in cattle than in sheep and goats
- Trouble with walking 
- High stepping walking 
- Unusual behaviour like walking into fences, circling, falling down, chewing movements (can look like rabies) 
- Slight tapping of the forehead with a finger causes blinking 
- Convulsions, with pedalling movements 
* Death
                                 
Dead animals 
* Large amounts of fluid in belly and chest and the sac surrounding the heart (especially in sheep and goats) 
* Swelling of the brain with fluid 
* Fluid in the lungs and froth in the airways 

Redwater 
Sick animals 
* There are two types of redwater, namely Asiatic redwater and African redwater 
* Asiatic redwater is the more serious disease, although African redwater is probably more important as it is more widely spread. The signs are the same, although nervous signs also occur with Asiatic redwater 
* Fever (40-41,5  degrees C) 
* Pale to yellow eyes and gums 
* Red-coloured urine 
* With Asiatic redwater there could be nervous signs, with difficulty in walking and convulsions (can look like heartwater) 
* Death 
* Calves are resistant for the first 6 to 9 months of life 

Dead animals 
* Pale or yellowish carcass 
* Blood thin and watery 
* Large spleen 
* Gallbladder large and filled with bile 
* Red-coloured urine 
* Brain pink in case of Asiatic redwater

Gallsickness 
Sick animals 
* May have a fever 
* Pale to yellow eyes and gums 
* Trouble with walking 
* Heavy breathing 
* Constipation (from rumen movements stopping) 
* Death 
* Calves are resistant for the first 6 to 9 months of life 

Dead animals 
* Yellowish carcass 
* Large spleen 
* Large gallbladder filled with thick brownish-green bile 

How can you know if your animals have these diseases? 
You can suspect these diseases by: 
 Clinical signs in sick animals
 Appearance of dead animals 
Your veterinarian or animal health technician will confirm this by looking for parasites in: 
 Blood smears for redwater and gallsickness
 Brain smears for heartwater and Asiatic redwater 
What other diseases can tick-borne diseases be confused with? 
* Any disease which causes similar signs 
* For example, the nervous signs seen with Asiatic redwater and heartwater can be the same, and can also look like diseases such as rabies and infection in the brain from other causes 
* The fluid in the lungs in the case of heartwater can look like poisoning or other diseases such as pulpy kidney and bluetongue 
* Gallsickness and redwater can look much the same 

The only way to be sure of the disease 
is to have it confirmed by tests 
on the sick or dead animal

How can tick-borne diseases be treated? 
* Animals must be treated quickly when signs of disease are noted, or they may die 
* Strictly follow the directions on the labels of drugs, otherwise the drug either will not work or may even harm the animal 
* If you are not sure which disease the animal has, you should seek advice 
* Some of the drugs prescribed for treatment can only be given to an animal by a veterinarian 
* If in doubt and you cannot quickly get help from your veterinarian you could perhaps use a combination of tetracycline and diminazene aceturate 
Heartwater 
* Tetracyclines (many different brands) 
Redwater 
* Imidocarb diproprionate (eg Imizol or Forray 65) or diminazene aceturate (eg Babazene, Berenil, Veriben) 
* Keep the animal quiet and do not let it walk long distances 
Gallsickness 
* Tetracyclines (many different brands) or imidocarb diproprionate (eg Imizol or Forray 65) 
* Keep the animal quiet and do not let it walk long distances 

How can tick-borne diseases be prevented or controlled? 
* The prevention and control of tick-borne diseases are very complex and varies in different areas. Ask your animal health technician or veterinarian for advice about the best methods in your area 
* Animals should preferably be exposed to the parasites at a young age so that they can develop natural immunity in areas where the diseases occur 
* Tick control by dipping or spraying can reduce the risk. Strategic tick control is good, as it is a level of control that prevents ticks becoming a nuisance, but allows enough ticks to remain for infection to occur at an early age so that the animals become protected against the diseases 
* Try to keep only tropical breeds such as Ngunis or Brahmans which are more resistant to ticks and tick-borne diseases 
* Vaccines are available for heartwater, redwater (both types) and gallsickness. The vaccines, particularly for heartwater, must be used carefully as they contain live parasites and can cause disease and even death if the animals are not treated in time. Pregnant animals should not be vaccinated, as abortion may occur

Introduction

What is the White Paper on Local Government? 
The present local government system is a temporary (transitional) system. It is intended to take us from the old apartheid system to a new, democratic system. It is the government's task to ensure that a new system is in place by the time the next local government elections take place in 1999.
The White Paper is the plan for the new system of local government. It was developed by the Ministry of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development after months of research and discussions with everyone concerned. It says what kind of local government system we want, and how we can achieve it.
Of course, it is not enough just to have a plan. Further steps will have to be taken to put the plan into action. Laws will have to be passed, new boundaries will have to be demarcated, new programmes will have to be developed, and people will have to be trained in new approaches to local government.
The White Paper provides us with a map which we can follow to make sure we reach our destination - a new, democratic system of local government which will take us into the twenty-first century. 

What is local government?
Local government is the level of government that is closest to the people. The area of local government is the municipality. The residents of the municipality elect a municipal council to represent their interests. The municipal council is responsible for ensuring the delivery of affordable basic services to everyone and for promoting economic and social development in the area. 


 
Section A: The Current Reality

Section A of the White Paper looks at where we are today - the problems and challenges we face. Many of these problems come from our history. Apartheid separated everyone into racial areas. Most of the wealth remained in the white areas while the majority of people lived in areas with few opportunities, few services or facilities and no way of raising money to improve the quality of life. 
In the 1980s, people resisted this unjust system and their struggle helped to bring about the end of apartheid.
Our present transitional system of local government is based on agreements reached during the negotiations. The transitional system has removed the old racial barriers - we now have single municipalities, not divided along racial lines. However, some problems remain. For example:
* The old problem of inequality remains: some areas are wealthy while many still do not have basic services. 
* There are equal quotas for ward seats from previously white and black municipal areas. This is not fair because the previously black areas have much larger populations. 
* There are fixed majorities required for voting on budgets and planning decisions. 
* Some councils are working well, but many are struggling and are not able to deliver services to their communities. The new system must revise the types and number of councils to ensure that they are fully able to perform the functions of local government. 
Apartheid settlements
We are left also with the problem of apartheid settlements that were designed not for development, but for separation and control. There is a big divide between rural and urban settlements. Our cities and towns are badly designed - the poorest people live furthest from work, and from services and facilities. In our rural areas, millions of people living in former homelands have little or no access to economic opportunity or to basic services. Small rural towns do not serve the needs of the majority of people living on the land around them.
The new system of local government will have to address these apartheid settlement problems. It will have to ensure that all areas are brought into the mainstream of development - especially those areas that were historically disadvantaged.
In short...
The new local government system must address the inequalities and backlogs of the past and ensure that everyone has access to basic services, to opportunities and an improved quality of life. Our people demand this, and our Constitution repeats this demand. We must have developmental local government. 


 
Section B: Developmental Local Government

Section B of the White Paper looks at what development means. It describes the kind of leadership which councils must provide and the kind of relationships which municipalities need to build with communities, organisations, business and others who can contribute to the development of the area. It also describes integrated development planning - the new approach to planning which will assist municipalities to fulfil their developmental role. 
What is developmental local government?
Our Constitution spells out the role of local government in democratic South Africa. Local government must be developmental. This is a big new challenge for local government.
In the past, local government was mainly concerned with providing services to white communities and with such things as traffic regulation, issuing licences and looking after parks and recreational facilities.
Now local government must ensure that all communities have access to basic services, that everyone can participate in decision-making and planning, that the local economy grows, that job opportunities increase, and that local resources are used wisely to improve the quality of life for everyone, now and in the future.
The key development roles of a municipality
Developmental local government is government which works with the community and all those who have a role to play to promote sustainable economic and social development. This means that local government must:
a) Provide community leadership
The municipality must work with all sections of the community to build a shared vision and to set goals for development. Once there is a shared vision and goals, the municipality needs to work hand-in-hand with the community to achieve the vision and goals.
b) Promote social and economic well-being
A municipality needs to ensure that all of its plans, policies, programmes and actions will lead to economic and social development and a better quality of life for all - particularly those historically disadvantaged.
c) Coordinate and integrate all efforts to develop the area
All available resources - human and material - will be needed to achieve development goals. A developmental municipality must keep open the channels of communication with other spheres of government and build partnerships with civic, private and public organisations. It must ensure that all efforts and contributions work together to achieve the common goal of development.
d) Promote and build local democracy
The municipal council represents the interests of the community. It must involve the local citizens and groups in decisions and processes that affect them. It must take special measures to ensure that those people who are often left on the sideline - like women heads of households, people with disabilities and youth - are able to participate.
What should developmental local government achieve?
Some of the key aims of developmental local government are:
a) To provide basic household infrastructure and services
Everyone in the area should have basic, affordable services - things such as access to clean water, waste removal and sewerage. The Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme (CMIP) is a national fund to assist municipalities to build the infrastructure needed for these services - things such as pipes, reservoirs and sewage treatment plants.
b) To plan for integrated cities, towns and rural areas
Apartheid divided our settlements along racial lines. Municipalities must plan to remove these divisions. Integrating our areas will bring down the costs of transport and services and improve access to job opportunities and recreational facilities. It will make our cities, towns and rural areas better places to live and will bring our previously divided communities together.
c) To promote local economic development
Municipalities cannot on their own provide jobs or create wealth. However, they can plan to ensure that the full economic potential of the area is developed. This will help to ensure that there are more jobs, more opportunities and more wealth.
For example, municipalities can ensure that when they buy goods and services, they buy from developing local businesses. When they build infrastructure, they can use people rather than machines where this is possible. They can provide support and information to small businesses or ensure that local businesses have access to organisations and programmes which can assist them. By providing sound leadership and uniting the community around common development goals, they can make the area an attractive place for investment and promote growth.
How can municipalities become more developmental?
Two essential tools for developmental local government:
1. Integrated development planning
Good planning is essential to development. Integrated development planning is a planning process specially designed to enable municipalities to plan effectively for development in their area. (All municipalities have to produce integrated development plans. The Department of Constitutional Development has produced a manual to help municipalities get started.) It involves:
* Working with the community to assess community needs. 
* Developing a common vision and setting priorities and goals. 
* Assessing what resources are available. 
* Designing programmes and projects. 
* Making sure that municipal programmes work together with other municipalities and provincial and national programmes. 
* Making sure that plans for different sectors (such as water, housing, waste, transport) work well together. 
* Proper financial planning and budgeting. 
* Plans for implementation. 
* Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of programmes to ensure that they are on track. 
2. Performance management
Municipalities need to measure their performance to ensure that they are achieving their goals. In order to do this, they need to set key performance indicators (KPIs). These are targets which they can use to check that programmes are on track and that resources are being used efficiently. Community groups should be involved in setting KPIs - this will help to build commitment throughout the community to common goals.
Over the next few years, a national performance management system will be developed, based on the experiences of municipalities. This will help to identify problems and address them before they become crises.
Community participation
Municipalities have a duty to involve local citizens in municipal affairs and to build local democracy. Citizens should be involved in planning and policy-making and as partners in development programmes.
In short...
Developmental local government means strong leadership, clear vision, maximum participation by the community, the private sector and all stakeholders to meet the basic needs of all and build solid foundations for growth and lasting prosperity. 

Developmental government is government whose main aim is to promote the economic and social development of the community. This includes things such as ensuring that everyone has access to basic services and that steps are taken to promote sustainable job creation. 
Sustainable development is development that can be sustained or continued into the future. In order for development to be sustainable, it must be built on solid foundations. Short-term solutions will count for nothing if tomorrow there is nothing to show for them. New projects must be properly operated and maintained in the future, and there must be the funds and capacity to do this.
Integrate means to bring together all the different plans, efforts and contributions so that they work to achieve the shared vision and goals of the community.
Integrated Development Planning
All municipalities have to produce integrated developmental plans (IDPs). The Department of Constitutional Development has produced a manual to help municipalities get started.


 
Section C: Co-operative Government

Section C of the White Paper looks at the relationship between national, provincial and local government. Under our new Constitution, each of these spheres of government must work together in a spirit of cooperation and support each other. 

The development challenges facing local government are enormous. But municipalities are not on their own. Local government is just one part of a new, cooperative system of government in South Africa. Municipalities are supported in their task by national and provincial government. And, in their turn, municipalities support provincial and national government. Working together, these three spheres of government can better achieve the aims of development.
Key roles of the three spheres of government
 
National
Provincial
Local
Development planning
Responsible for developing the overall framework for social and economic development in the country.
Responsible for developing a development framework for each province - called the Provincial Growth and Development Strategy.
Municipalities are responsible for developing development plans for their own areas - called integrated development plans. These IDPs must work together with the Provincial Growth and Development Strategy.
Laws and regulations
Responsible for developing the overall legislative framework (the laws) for local government. The White Paper is part of this law-making process.
Pass laws and regulations for local government - in line with national laws - to meet provincial and local needs.
Make local by-laws and regulate land use, local tariffs, street trading, etc.
Capacity-building
Responsibility to build the capacity of municipalities so that they can manage their own affairs and perform their functions effectively.
Provide municipalities with training and capacity-building. They will work through provincial training structures and organised local government. They will also offer technical assistance for such things as developing IDPs.
Municipal councils have a duty to develop their staff through training and other measures.
Finance
Manage the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations. It will pass laws on matters such as the "equitable share" of national revenue to go to municipalities.
Monitor the financial health of municipalities, and intervene if finances become unsound.
Municipal councils are responsible for producing five-year financial plans and annual budgets, setting tariffs, metering services, credit control, collecting revenue, tageting the "equitable share" to the poor, etc.
Monitoring
Producing an overall system for monitoring local government to ensure that information is accurate and there is no duplication in reporting.
Monitor municipalities, according to the national monitoring system. This is to ensure that there are high standards of government and public service.
Set key performance indicators and report regularly on them.
Intervention
May provide guidelines for intervention when municipalities experience difficulties, and may itself intervene as a last resort.
Can intervene if a municipality fails to fulfil its constitutional duties. If a provincial government takes over a municipal function, it must ensure that the council can resume responsibility for that function as soon as possible.
Take corrective action according to the MEC's recommendations or instructions.
National and provincial programmes
National and provincial departments have programmes that affect municipalities directly. For example, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry's Community Water and Sanitation Programme, and the Department of Land Affairs planning grant to assist municipalities to do their land development objectives / integrated development plans.
Municipalities can assist with the delivery of these programmes. At the same time, these programmes can build the capacity of local government and form part of the municipality's own development programme.
Also, some national and provincial departments are decentralising certain functions to local government. This means that municipalities will have additional, new functions.
In order for national, provincial and local government to cooperate effectively in the delivery of programmes:
* National and provincial departments should work directly through and with local government. 
* National and provincial programmes should be built into municipal IDPs. 
* Local Government MINMEC should coordinate any decentralisation of departmental powers and functions to local government - this will ensure that there is adequate funding for local government to carry out additional functions. 
Cooperation between municipalities
Municipalities can gain a lot by building relationships with each other. For example, they can:
* Exchange learning experiences. 
* Share staff and technology. 
* Undertake joint investment projects. 
* Collectively purchase things such as equipment, bulk services and advisory services. 
* Provide services to each other. 
Organised local government
The South African Local Government Association (Salga) is the national body representing local government. It has nine provincial associations. These bodies can promote cooperation between municipalities. They can also give a voice to local government through their representation on the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) and Local Government MINMEC.
Also, Salga is an employers' association which can build constructive relations with municipal unions and contribute to good labour relations.
In short...
Working together, national, provincial and local government can more effectively promote national development, make the best use of available resources and ensure good government and high standards of public service. 

Intergovernmental fiscal relations: the transfer of money from national to provincial and local government. 
"Equitable share": the Constitution states that municipalities are entitled to receive a share of national revenue. National government will determine what this share will be. Click here to the Manual
Decentralise: hand over a function to a local body that is better able to perform the functions efficiently and effectively.
Local Government MINMEC is a national committee dealing with all matters affecting local government. Its members are the Minister for Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development, the nine provincial MECs for local government and Salga.


 
Section D: Institutional Systems

Section D of the White Paper looks at the three different categories of municipality and the different types of municipality in each category. 
The categories of municipality
The Constitution establishes three categories of municipality.
Category (A): A municipality that has exclusive municipal executive and legislative authority in its area.
Category (B): A municipality that shares municipal executive and legislative authority in its area with a Category (C) municipality within whose area it falls.
Category (C): A municipality that has municipal executive and legislative authority in an area that includes more than one municipality.
National government will set the criteria for when an area should have a category (A) municipality or both (B) and (C) municipalities.
The types of municipality
In each of these categories there can be different types of municipality. National government will decide what these different types will be. Provincial government will decide which types of municipality will apply in the province.
Metropolitan areas
Metropolitan areas are large urban areas with large populations. There are six metropolitan areas in South Africa: Greater Johannesburg, Greater Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban, Lekoa-Vaal and Kayalami.
These areas need special arrangements for government. Metropolitan government can provide the necessary overall management of these large urban areas. This is needed to promote economic and social development for the whole area - separate municipalities tend to be interested only in their own area and not in the metropolitan area as a whole. It can also ensure that the wealth of the whole area is used for everyone's benefit - particularly for those who have been historically disadvantaged.
The White Paper proposes two different types of metropolitan government:
1. Metropolitan government with ward committees. 
2. Metropolitan government with metropolitan substructures. 
Provincial government will decide which of the two types will apply in the province.
The two types of metropolitan government
1. Metropolitan government with ward committees
In this type of metropolitan government, the metropolitan council will have all powers over municipal functions. It can decide to manage all functions itself or it can decentralise some functions to local units. It can decide how to organise its administrative capacity.
Ward committees will be established at ward level to ensure that local residents have access to metropolitan government. The ward committees must strengthen accountability to local communities. The metropolitan council will decide what powers and functions ward committees will have. Ward committees should play a role in determining local needs and priorities - an important part of IDPs. They should be consulted on matters affecting the local area.
2. Metropolitan government with metropolitan substructures
The metropolitan council will organise its administrative capacity in a decentralised way through metropolitan substructures. Substructures are subcommittees of the council for a particular area. They are composed of ward and proportional representation councillors for that area. The metropolitan council will decide which powers and functions to decentralise to these substructures. This can include most direct service delivery functions such as refuse collection and sanitation, and local planning decisions. The council may decide to keep responsibility for some services such as water supply or electricity - or, it may share these functions with substructures.
The roles of metropolitan government
Metropolitan government must:
* Promote equity and social justice. 
* Ensure that the tax base benefits everyone in the metropolitan area. 
* Plan for the metropolitan area as a whole so that apartheid fragmentation is reversed, economic efficiency is increased and social integration is promoted. 
* Promote local democracy by facilitating the participation of citizens in the government of their local areas and of the whole city - ward committees and substructures will have a vital role to play in building democracy. 
* Provide efficient and effective services - as a priority, basic services must be provided to those who do not yet enjoy them. 
District government
All areas outside of metropolitan areas will have district government (category C) and local municipalities (category B). National legislation will decide how powers and functions will be divided between the district council and the local municipality.
The non-metropolitan areas have a very wide range of settlement types - from large secondary cities to scattered rural areas. District government is necessary to ensure planning and development for the whole district, as well as to assist those local municipalities which do not yet have the capacity or a big enough tax base to deliver all municipal functions.
Roles of district government
* Plan integrated development for the whole district - district councils will have to develop IDPs for the whole district. This will ensure that municipal IDPs work together with national and provincial programmes to develop the whole district. 
* Provide bulk infrastructure - district councils will be able to raise funds for this through establishment levies (the old RSC levies). 
* Provide technical assistance to weaker municipalities. 
* Provide services in those areas where municipalities are unable to do so because of small tax bases or low demand for services. 
Category B municipal councils (local councils)
In district government areas there will be three types of category (B) municipality.
1. Urban municipalities.
2. Amalgamated urban-rural municipalities.
3. Rural municipalities.
Urban municipalities
Most towns and cities will have urban municipalities with the responsibility to provide all municipal services. Informal settlements and other settlements on the outskirts of these towns will be brought within the municipal area.
Amalgamated urban-rural municipalities
In some cases, the boundaries of an existing municipality will be extended to include the surrounding area. This might mean joining an urban and a rural municipality together. This will increase the tax-base and allow for more efficient planning and delivery.
Rural municipalities
There is a large variety of rural settlements in the country. The capacity of municipalities in these areas varies from good to very poor. The White Paper proposes that all rural municipalities will begin with a basic set of powers and functions. The remaining powers and functions will be carried out by district government. When a rural municipality's capacity increases, it will take on more powers and functions. The stronger rural municipalities might be able to take on a wide range of powers and functions immediately. Others will do so over time, as their capacity develops.
In a very few areas with tiny populations spread out over a wide area, a category (B) municipality might not be possible. In these exceptional cases, special arrangements will be made to ensure that residents are represented through the district council.
Traditional leadership
The White Paper deals with the relationship between local government and traditional leadership - not with other aspects of traditional leadership. The White Paper proposes a cooperative relationship between municipalities and traditional leadership. Traditional leaders will have representation on local and district councils, to advise on the needs and aspirations of their people. This role is different from the role of voting by councillors. Provincial government will play a role in deciding what ceremonial functions should be given to traditional leaders.
A White Paper on Traditional Affairs is being prepared and government departments are addressing issues affecting traditional leadership.
At present there are 843 municipalities and 11 300 councillors in South Africa. The number of municipalities and councillors should be reduced so that municipalities can provide better services at a lower cost.
Demarcation of boundaries
The Municipal Demarcation Board will determine municipal boundaries, in consultation with MECs for local government and municipalities. National government will set the criteria for demarcation. Care will be taken to ensure that municipal boundaries enable municipalities to fulfil their constitutional duties. 

Executive and legislative authority: the powers to make policy and implement national and provincial laws and municipal by-laws. 
Criteria: the rules or conditions which have to be followed when making choices about different categories of municipality.
Decentralise: hand over a function to a local body that is better able to perform the functions efficiently and effectively.
Tax-base: the sources of revenue from which a municipality can raise money to perform its functions. This includes shops, businesses, property owners who pay rates, etc.
Bulk infrastructure: the piping, cables and other equipment needed to deliver large quantities of water, electricity or gas to central points in a municipal area. From these points, more infrastructure is needed to deliver the water or electricity directly to the users.
Demarcation: Every municipal boundary in the country has to be drawn on a map to show exactly the area that a council is responsible for. The process of deciding where to draw the boundaries is called demarcation.


 
Section E: Political Systems

Section E of the White Paper deals with the powers and functions of councils. This includes the role of mayors, executive committees and other committees. 
How decisions are made
Every municipality has a council which is responsible for making political decisions, and an administration which must carry out the decisions taken by the council. The Constitution says that all decisions concerning the exercise of municipal powers and functions must be taken by the council. However, it is not always efficient - especially in large councils - for the whole council to make decisions. For this reason, national laws will allow councils to delegate executive powers to an executive mayor or to an executive committee. The only powers which may not be delegated are:
* Passing by-laws. 
* Approving budgets. 
* Imposing rates, taxes, levies and other duties. 
* Raising loans. 
These things must be done by the council as a whole.
Where the council delegates powers to a mayor or an executive committee, the council will be able to monitor the performance of the mayor or executive committee and hold them accountable for their actions.
An executive mayor
An executive mayor is elected by and from the municipal council. The council decides which powers will be delegated to the mayor. The council may also allow the mayor to appoint a cabinet of a small number of councillors to assist her/him. However, it is the mayor who exercises powers, not the cabinet. The advantage of an executive mayor is that it gives a human face to local government and allows for strong, decisive leadership. It is easier for the public to identify with an individual than with a committee.
An executive committee
An executive committee is a group of councillors elected by the municipal council. The mayor is the chairperson of the executive committee. However, the mayor is not an executive mayor - powers lie with the executive committee as a whole, not with the mayor. The council decides which powers to delegate to the executive committee.
Provincial government will decide which type of decision-making systems will apply in the province.
Other committees
Councils can establish other committees to assist them. These include:
* Management and supervisory committees - to oversee functions such as water provision or waste management. 
* Area committees - to oversee functions in a particular area. 
* Policy committees - to formulate policy on a particular issue in a given time. 
Large municipalities should also establish an audit committee (to oversee auditing of municipal finances) and a tender committee (to manage the tendering process).
Dynamic leadership
Dynamic, able and dedicated leadership is required to enable municipalities to facilitate development and ensure high levels of public service. Councillors have to provide community-wide leadership and vision. They must be able to build partnerships with business, community organisations and other groups who can contribute to development. They must be able to take complex policy decisions and increase accountability and transparency.
However, many of the 11 300 councillors in South Africa are part-time. They struggle to manage both their work and council commitments. The White Paper therefore proposes to reduce the overall number of councillors and to increase the proportion of full-time councillors, dedicated to their council work.
Municipal elections
Municipal councils will be elected in the following way:
There will be a party vote on the basis of proportional representation.
There will be a ward vote of the basis of first past the post.
The party vote decides the overall number of seats a party is entitled to. This total number is made up of both ward seats and party seats. The number of party seats is determined by subtracting the number of ward seats won through the ward vote from the total number of seats won in the party vote.
Example of voting

There are 20 seats on the council. 
IN THE PARTY VOTE: 
Party Z wins 70% of the party vote
This means Party Z has 14 seats
(70% of 20) = TOTAL OF 14 seats
IN THE WARD VOTE: 
Party Z wins 6 ward seats
NUMBER OF PARTY SEATS: 
Party Z is entitled to an additional 8 party seats to make the total of 14 (14 - 6 ward seats = 8) won in the party vote.
PARTY Z therefore has 6 ward seats and 8 party seats.
Women candidates
Political parties are encouraged to introduce a gender quota system. This will ensure that more women candidates stand for election to municipal councils.
In short...
Developmental local government requires strong, capable leadership with vision. The decision-making systems proposed in the White Paper aim to strengthen councillors and streamline decision-making, for more efficient and effective municipal government. 

Delegate: hand over powers and functions to another body or person. 
Executive powers: the authority to make policy and decisions concerning the overall operations of the municipality.
Proportional representation: Parties are awarded seats according to the percentage of the total votes that they receive.
First past the post: Only one candidate wins the seat - the candidate with the most votes.


 
Section F: Administrative Systems

Municipal administrations include the management and workforce of municipal departments responsible for carrying out the policies and programmes of the council. The administration has the task of delivering quality services to residents. Section E of the White Paper proposes creative approaches to extend basic services to everyone and to improve service delivery generally. 
Different approaches to service delivery
Municipalities need to find the most efficient ways to deliver affordable, quality services to residents - and in particular to those who do not yet have basic services. The White Paper proposes a variety of ways to achieve this. Municipalities will have to choose the best combination of approaches to meet their service delivery and development goals.
Capacity-building
Most municipalities need to improve their management systems and train and empower their workforce. This could include measures such as:
Management reform
Worker empowerment
Performance contracts for senior staff
Empower front-line workers to provide information and advice to the community 
Codes of conduct
Training and development for the workforce
Affirmative action
Decentralising operational management responsibilities
Clear performance measurements
Hands on experience and knowledge of front-line workers should be used to improve service
Corporatisation
This involves establishing service delivery units, managed along commercial lines, separate from the administration but accountable to the council.
Public-public partnerships
These are partnerships between the municipality and other public sector bodies. An example is a partnership between a municipality and the Post Office which allows the public to pay their bills at the Post Office. This makes payment convenient for residents and removes the burden of collection from the administration.
Partnerships with community-based organisations (CBOs) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)
CBOs and NGOs have skills and experience which can be valuable to the administration - for example, in training, development projects and small business development.
Contracting out
This involves the municipality contracting with a private company to provide a specific service. Such contracts can keep costs down and improve efficiency. The council must monitor performance and ensure standards and quality are maintained.
Leases and concessions
These are similar to contracting out but involve large-scale capital investment in infrastructure. For this reason, the contract period is longer (often 20 to 30 years) and the contractor is expected to take charge of the infrastructure and invest in it. The contractor usually takes responsibility for revenue collection. At the end of the contract, ownership of the infrastructure returns to the municipality.
Transfer of ownership
Privatisation involves selling municipal assets to a private company which then has responsibility for delivering a service. At this stage, basic services - such as water, waste, electricity and solid waste - should not be sold completely. However, councils could consider privatising non-essential services. This could boost municipal revenue and allow the council to concentrate on essential services.
NOTE: National legislation will provide a framework for municipalities entering into partnerships with the private sector.
Focus on customer service
Front-line staff interact with the community on a daily basis. They actually carry out service delivery. They need to be able to provide information and advice to the public. It is equally important that systems for billing are efficient and convenient for the public to use.
Labour relations
Municipal trade unions and organised local government have a key role to play in ensuring good employer-employee relations and a sound labour relations system. The South African Local Government Bargaining Council (SALGBC) will play a role in developing a partnership between municipal trade unions, management and councils and a framework for resolving disputes. A priority will be to negotiate common conditions of service for municipal staff and a municipal job evaluation system, improve performance and create a sound basis for transformation.
Local government training
Staff training
The existing training boards have not been able to meet the challenges facing developmental local government. The training system will be reorganised. A national local government sector education and training authority will regulate local government training and manage an education and training fund. Provincial training structures - with representatives from labour and provincial and local government - will determine provincial needs, award tenders to training organisations, and monitor the training. Service providers will include universities, technikons, NGOs, municipal training departments, professional bodies and commercial training providers.
Councillor training
Salga will play a major role in councillor training. A councillor training programme will be developed to coincide with municipal elections.
In short...
To meet developmental goals, municipal administrations need to improve management, empower the workforce and consider a range of new, creative approaches to service delivery. 


 
Section G: Municipal Finance

This section of the White Paper deals with how to restructure the system of municipal finances so that municipalities are able to balance their budgets and provide quality services. It looks at four key areas of municipal finance: 
* Revenue. 
* Intergovernmental transfers. 
* Private sector investment. 
* Budgeting, accounting and reporting. 
Revenue
Municipalities need reliable sources of revenue. On average municipalities finance 90% of their day-to-day expenditure from their own revenues, not from national government. However, some municipalities - particularly rural municipalities - do not have a large enough tax-base to finance themselves. These municipalities will receive a large part of the share of national revenue reserved for local government. Other ways to increase revenue for poorer municipalities - such as a property tax for rural areas - will be investigated.
Even for those municipalities which are viable, there is a need to improve the system of finance to ensure the best use of resources, to address backlogs and inequalities and to promote accountability. The White Paper proposes the following:
Property taxation
There needs to be a uniform property rating system throughout the country. This includes such things as the way property is evaluated, the period of valuation and ways of assisting those who cannot afford to pay full rates.
Levies
Metropolitan and districts governments impose RSC and JSB levies. These are taxes on businesses based on the number of employees. They are an important source of revenue and should remain. But there is a danger that they discourage employment and that if a municipality's levies are too high, business will move to other areas. National government will take steps to address these problems.
Fuel levy
Part of the national fuel levy may be given to local government for road maintenance.
Service charges
Charges for services - such as water, electricity and sewerage - are the largest source of income for most municipalities. It is therefore important that consumers pay the full cost of these services. A system of subsidies should be introduced to ensure that those who cannot afford to pay the full cost at least have basic services. How the subsidy system works should be very clear to all residents.
To ensure that costs are recovered, municipalities must have efficient metering, regular and accurate billing and stiff penalties for those who can pay but choose not to pay.
Intergovernmental transfers
This is money transferred form national to local government. There are three kinds of transfer:
* Agency payments. 
* Capital transfers. 
* Transfers for operating costs. 
Agency costs
These are payments to municipalities when they deliver services on behalf of provincial government. Municipalities must ensure that they are fully paid for work they carry out on behalf of the province.
Capital transfers
These are funds for building infrastructure. Since 1997, these transfers have been made through the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme. This has helped to streamline payments to municipalities. Steps will be taken to improve the system of payment to rural municipalities.
Transfers for operating costs
The Constitution (Section 214) states that municipalities are entitled to an "equitable share" of national revenue. This share will be the funds transferred to municipalities for operating costs - the day-to-day running costs of the municipality. A problem at the moment is that municipalities are not sure how much money they will receive, or when they will receive it. This makes it difficult for municipalities to plan ahead.
To overcome these problems, the "equitable share" (the total amount available to local government for operating costs) will be worked out five years in advance, through the government's medium-term expenditure framework (a five year budget plan). The equitable share will be distributed to municipalities according to a formula. The formula will be based on equity - ensuring that municipalities can provide a basic level of services to low-income households at an affordable cost. A large part of the "equitable share" will therefore go to those municipalities which have most need of national assistance, particularly rural municipalities.
Funds will be transferred directly to municipalities. Municipalities will have to ensure that the benefits of basic services reach low-income households.
Private sector investment
Municipalities need private sector investment to address backlogs and give everyone access to basic services. The White Paper suggests a number of ways to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure.
Borrowing
National government is looking at ways to make it easier for municipalities to borrow from private financial institutions. This can best be done by reducing the risks involved for lenders and for national and provincial government. This means:
* Proper budgeting and financial management by municipalities. 
* Good credit control to make sure that users pay for services. 
* Clear rules set by national government. 
* Clear steps to be followed if a municipality fails to repay loans. 
* A financial monitoring system that clearly shows the state of health of a municipality's finances. 
Concessional loan finance
Municipalities should be able to borrow from the private sector on the open market. However, some municipalities are simply not in a position to do this. As a stepping stone to private sector borrowing, specialised public sector institutions can assist municipalities to develop the financial discipline which private sector borrowing demands.
The Development Bank of Southern Africa, and the Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit can assist municipalities to prepare projects and get access to loans for capital works.
Budgeting, accounting and reporting
Generally accepted accounting practice is being introduced in municipalities and already there are good results. Generally accepted accounting practice involves the following things:
Accounting for internal funds
There should be a simpler system of keeping records of municipal funds and assets. This would allow the council and the public a clearer understanding of the true financial position of the municipality. For example, there should be fewer bank accounts and a simpler way of recording how municipal funds are spent on fixed assets. Municipalities need to budget for the fact that not all the money owed to them will be paid. This could mean that they will have less income than they expected.
Accounting for fixed assets
Fixed assets - such as pipes for water, sub-stations for electricity - cost a certain amount when they are first bought. But over time they lose value. If municipalities don't take this into account in their budgets, they will not know the real cost of providing services. They will not charge consumers the real cost of the service. More realistic values of fixed assets will enable the council to improve financial planning and budgeting.
Internal reporting
Information needs to be available to councillors and the administration. Regulations have been introduced for a standard system of financial reporting. This will ensure that essential financial information is regularly presented to councillors and administrators in a way that is easy to understand.
External reporting
National and provincial government have a responsibility to monitor the financial position of municipalities. This is best achieved through the municipalities' annual financial statements which are submitted to the Auditor-General. Municipalities should also make accurate and understandable financial reports available to the public.
In short...
Municipal finances must be well-managed to provide services, attract private investment and make the best use of available resources. Steps are already being taken to introduce standard best accounting practices to municipalities. These will enable decision-makers to make informed decisions and the public to know how public funds are being managed. 

Viable: having sufficient resources and capacity to deliver municipal services. 
Assets and fixed assets: Assets are everything the municipality owns and which have a money value, for example, land, buildings, roads, other service infrastructure, motor vehicles, computer equipment, works of art, etc. Fixed assets are assets that cannot be moved - for example, land, buildings and infrastructure.


 
Section H: The Transformation Process

The last section of the White Paper looks at the steps that will be taken to implement the new system of developmental local government. 
Demarcation of boundaries
An important step in implementing the new local government system will be nation-wide municipal elections in 1999-2000. National government is preparing for these elections by establishing the Municipal Demarcation Board which will draw up municipal boundaries and ward boundaries within municipalities.
Laws and regulations
Changes to certain laws and regulations, as well as new laws and regulations, are needed to allow the White Paper to be implemented. National and provincial government are also preparing the laws and regulations which will enable the new system to be implemented. These laws and regulations will go through the normal parliamentary procedures before becoming law.

Support programme for transformation
In addition, national and provincial government are setting up a support programme for local government which includes:
* A coordinated capacity-building programme to develop local government personnel and structures. 
* Training in management and development skills. 
* Technical assistance for improving service delivery systems. 
* Support for integrated development planning and local economic development. 
* Establishment of a performance management system. 
* Streamlining financial systems so that municipalities know well in advance what funds they will receive from national government. 
* Funding for certain key aspects of transformation. 
* Working with Salga to support councillors and council employees in their new roles. 
However, the success of transformation really lies with every councillor, official and citizen. Every one of us must make our contribution to development and democracy in the areas where we live. 

Directorate Communication
Zoonotic diseases
Jenny Turton 
      
Zoonotic diseases are diseases that people can get from animals 
 
Why should you know about these diseases? 
* Zoonotic diseases can be serious in people and could even lead to death 
* You should know the dangers of zoonotic diseases and how people can get them so that you can prevent or reduce the risk of getting them 
How do people get zoonotic diseases? 
There are different ways that people can get zoonotic diseases depending on the particular disease. 
Some of the most important ways are: 
* Being bitten by an infected animal (e.g. rabies) 
* Eating infected meat or drinking infected milk (e.g. anthrax and tuberculosis) 
* Handling infected or dead animals, aborted foetuses and afterbirths 
(e.g. brucellosis) 

How to prevent zoonotic diseases 
It is important to know how people can become infected by the different zoonotic diseases. 
When you know this, you can prevent disease by avoiding the risk factors. Certain preventive measures should always be considered: 

Good hygiene 
* Always wash your hands 
- after handling animals, carcasses or meat 
- after using the toilet 
- before eating or preparing food 

* Use toilets. Never use the veld as a toilet, or if you have to, dig a deep hole and cover up with soil 
* Clean up dog and cat faeces lying around and prevent children from coming into contact with these 

Correct food preparation 
* 
o When slaughtering animals, cutting up meat and preparing food avoid contamination with dirt, flies, faeces and dirty water 
o Do not eat meat from animals that have died either suddenly or after being ill 
o Do not eat meat which contains lumps, does not look normal or has an unusual smell 
o Cook meat well, particularly game 

* 

* 

o Buy meat from reputable dealers only 
o Boil milk which has not been pasteurised 
o Do not keep perishable food for long periods before use 
o Keep perishable food refrigerated when possible 
o Wash dirt from vegetables before eating 


Take care when handling sick or dead animals, aborted foetuses and afterbirth
* Do not cut open animals which have died suddenly 
* Use gloves when opening up a dead animal, handling aborted foetuses or afterbirth, or assisting during birth 

C D Seegers
* Wash hands in soap and water and even disinfectant after handling sick or dead animals, aborted foetuses and afterbirth 
* Burn or bury carcasses, especially those from animals that have died suddenly 
Good animal health measures

 Vaccinate animals against the serious diseases affecting animals and people to protect both yourself and your animals (e.g. rabies, brucellosis, anthrax)

C D Seegers
* Deworm pets 
* Have cattle tested yearly for brucellosis and tuberculosis. If the cattle are positive for these diseases, you should sell them for controlled slaughter through an outlet where the meat will be inspected. Do not sell them to other people, because you are then only passing the problem on to them 
* Do not feed raw offal to animals 
Wash bite wounds promptly with soap and water and disinfectant, and seek medical attention

C D Seegers

Bites from animals can spread diseases (e.g. rabies and tetanus). There are many bacteria in an animal's mouth which can cause infection 

Do not handle strange or wild animals that appear tame

Control rats and flies

Can zoonotic diseases be treated?
* Some of these diseases can be treated, but you can get very sick and even die from others (e.g. rabies and anthrax) 

C D Seegers 
* Remember: PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN CURE!
