/// This structure completely describes the characters used in alphabet.
/// It maps from the "symbol" type (integers, starting at 1 for alphabet
/// characters, with 0 used for error / "unknown") to display text (that
/// rendered onto the canvas - e.g. a box or "_" for a space character),
/// text (that which is written/output, or indeed, read in by CAlphabetMap),
/// colour (an index into the current colour scheme; note values below 130
/// are increased by 130 on alternate offsets, this is known as the "phase"),
/// also foreground colour information (but these does not seem to be used
/// ATM).
///
/// One CAlphInfo object is created per alphabet when the alphabet.*.xml
/// files are read in by CAlphIO, and a CAlphabetMap object is created for
/// the alphabet currently in use (and deleted when the alphabet is changed).
///
/// Note the group structure stored by inheriting from SGroupInfo; these are filled
/// with iStart==1 (as symbol numbers are 1-indexed; 0 is reserved to indicate an
/// "unknown symbol", and for element 0 of the prob. array to contain a 0, and
/// symbol -1 indicates End-Of-Stream), and iEnd == one more than the number of
/// "text" symbols (i.e. inc space and para, but no control/conversion start/end)
/// - this is for consistency with SGroupInfo, preserving that iEnd is one more
/// than the highest valid index.
