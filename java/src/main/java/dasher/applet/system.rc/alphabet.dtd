<!-- The encoding field just helps Dasher decide on some Localisation
issues. In theory it could see which characters are there and pick
a suitable file encoding and font. Sometimes this is difficult.
It does not dictate the file format. For example, traditionally Unix
and Windows use different encodings for some languages. A platform
should do what what it thinks best given the vague group Dasher
has put the alphabet into. If this doesn't work out, the user
can over-ride the alphabet anyway. -->
